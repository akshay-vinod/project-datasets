 hi  I'm a 21 year-old male from the uk  over the past few months I have become increasingly depressed.  I'm always acting the joker and appear to be happy at university and work but every night I go to bed and hope that I won't wake up in the morning. For the past 3 or 4 years I've had an overwhelming feeling that I won't live very long and over the past few months I have the sensation that I will die very soon. my depression also leads me to get very angered.  I've never spoken to anyone about this.,1
" I was just curious what your feelings are on long-term outcomes for depression. A little background for me: I've been on and off medicines for several years. I was always depressed as a child  but didn't really seek professional help until maybe 10 years ago. I originally went on medicines. for severe pms prescribed to me by my ob-gyn. I just kind of continued on with it because it made me feel ""leveled out"". Then I had issues with sleep apnea  joint pains etc. My neurologist put me on Effexor. Every time I tried to go off that drug I was dizzy and had bad side effects. Finally  I reduced the dose myself and weaned myself off the Effexor. I had gained a tremendous amount of weight. I was off all medicines for 8 months and then I really feel into a dark depression. It was then that I sought a therapist  etc. I have been on medicines ever since...since June of 2004. I had lost 40 pounds by going off the medicines  but then became depressed again. following several deaths and major life events. I was put on Lexapro and gained weight. Not wanting to gain weight again  I hated being on the medicines. He kept saying it will stabilize. I told him that the weight gain was making me more depressed. Finally  he changed my medicines to Wellbutrin. We talked about trying to go off medicines when life events settled down...my main reason to go off was the weight gain. Immediately the weight came back off. That was a year ago. Now a year later  I am still losing about a pound or two a month. The last time I went in  he didn't say anything about going off the medicines. How long do people take medicines? Is it just better to stay on them and not fall back into the hole? Are there any long-term use side effects to be concerned with? Is this something I will probably be on forever? It just seems like I will always be like this. It just seems like depression is always just standing back in the shadows. I go for a very long time and feel fine and then I have a week where I get very down and know that if I wasn't on medicines. it would be very bad. I haven't gone to talk to my therapist in a long while. When I am having these bouts of depression  should I call and say I need to go in for a ""check-up"". I don't really have any specific issues to discuss. The big thing right now is I just feel down because I have lost my closest friends and don't feel like I have any friends to do anything with. I feel so isolated. Would it be good to just call and go in? I just feel stupid saying I feel sad because I don't have any friends. Are there any good books that you can recommend on self-help--esp. negative thinking  understanding why I think the way I do  etc. I found Dr. Phil's book on Life Strategies to be very helpful in discovering that there are reasons why I do things and think.",1
 Hi. I'm new to the forums. I was going to lurk for a bit before I posted  but there's so many of us  (I mean  I knew. but I didn't know.. you know? :) it seems like the thing to do. I'm a 24 year old male and I've had problems with depression for as long as I can remember  though it's become worse over the last year or so. I was pretty heavily involved in music and martial arts for years  but I'm no longer motivated to do either. I'm still going to school  though Hi. I'm new to the forums. I was going to lurk for a bit before I posted  but there's so many of us  (I mean  I knew. but I didn't know.. you know? :) it seems like the thing to do. I'm a 24 year old male and I've had problems with depression for as long as I can remember  though it's become worse over the last year or so. I was pretty heavily involved in music and martial arts for years  but I'm no longer motivated to do either. I'm still going to school  though I have no real direction and I'm afraid that my lack of motivation is going to cause me to screw that up too.  I started having anxiety attacks about a year ago and they've increased in frequency the last few months. They're (not to sound melodramatic) the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with. If I'm in panic-attack mode  any slight pain or discomfort quickly becomes a life-threatening illness that is surely going to kill me in the next few minutes. As ridiculous as that sounds  it's absolutely real when it's happening and I live in almost constant fear it's going to happen again. I have a hard time even driving anymore (especially on the freeway) and increasingly rely on my girlfriend for menial things like going to the store. She is very supportive and is aware that something is wrong  though I don't think she understands to what extent. I've started completely avoiding any situation in which I have to meet new people and have a hard time even talking to people I don't know on the phone. These symptoms have been increasing in intensity over the last 6 months or so and exponentially for the last 3 weeks (I just lost my job). It seems like quite a few of you have been dealing with these sorts of things for much longer and I'm sorry if my posting here so soon seems insensitive  but its already getting to the point where I know I can't handle living like this for years on end. I've suffered from depression for (relative to my age) a long time and the anxiety attacks are absolutely terrifying (a little redundant  I know). It feels like the last year is the beginning of everything completely falling apart. I guess my posting here is a way to get the ball rolling towards getting some help. I don't have health insurance anymore and I'm not sure where to go from here. I've been medicated in the past  but I haven't taken anything in a few years. Though  without insurance I'm not even sure that's an option. That's enough for now. Thanks for providing a resource like this. The anonymity of the internet lets me say some of the things I'm afraid to say to everyone else.,1
 Hi I am new to the group. I don't know if I am supposed to even post here. I am not too good with the computer yet!! I feel stupid! I have severe anxiety  and am feeling depressed. I have been struggling with this for years. I am 40 years old and that even depresses me!! I am on xanax for my anxiety  but they don't even help me any more. My doctor has me on 1 mg three times a day. I get the tremors when they ware off!! It is a horrible feeling! I have been on them for Five years and I feel so upset  because I depend on them so much! I wish I could get off them and don't know how. I never thought I would ever be addicted to anything .but I am. I feel like xanax runs my life. I even tremor in the middle of the night. I tried so many Anti-depressants and they make me feel so physically sick. I just really need some advice  and some support! I am crying all the time  and keep having flash backs of bad memories in my life. I have a understanding Mom and Dad  they tries to help me out. At least I am blessed with them. I just want to find happiness again. I have a daughter who is 11 years old and I feel guilty. because  I don't want her to keep seeing me like this!! I try to keep it together around her. She was diagnosed with OCD at 6 years old. It comes and goes with her. I feel like I am the blame for that even! I joined this group a week ago or so and this is my first time posting. I was told to post at the new members' site. I don't know if I am doing this in the right place. I am confused  with all this! I just need to learn more about using the computer!! I would appreciate any help or advice!,1
" I've dealt with panic / anxiety / depression / ptsd for some time now.   I was in a 14 year abusive marriage and it has been two years since I left that marriage.  This past August was one year since my divorce was final.  I have two children  both boys  6 and 10.  My ten year old has ADHD and depression.  I worry constantly for my kids because of what they saw during our marriage.   There are so many times I get so overwhelmed and just need to be around people who just ""get it.""  When I left  I brought my kids and myself home to my parents.  I have been with them since.  My mother  doesn't ""get it.""  She thinks that just because I left the marriage  I should be okay by now.  Well I guess 14 years may take a little longer than 2 years to fix.   I used to come here a long time ago.  I'm glad I came back.  I have seen so many familiar faces already and met new ones as well.  I just want a place where I feel I belong.  A place where I can go when I just need someone to be there.  It's been a long road  with many twists and turns ... I guess it's like that poem  the road less traveled.  I guess that means learning the hard way. ",1
" I know this might not fall under ""depression""  but it strongly relates to my depression. Example: Today I ran into a kid Brendon from my school and he said hi and started to talk to me. I went on with the conversation  but felt so uncomfortable. I know him and all  but after the conversation  I find myself saying ""Wow...that was awful...I suck at life."" I hate myself and I always think that everyone is laughing at me. Even when two people are laughing I always think that they're laughing at me. I'm purposely putting off my license test because of this fear. Does anyone have any helping words? Thank you everyone.",1
" Does anyone else get very angry at just stupid little things?  It seems like over the last few months everyone around me is getting all they want out of life  and I am suffering with depression.  Which  of course  makes me feel worse and then I feel guilty for not being happy for them.  BUT  I also get angry when they ""flaunt"" their happiness around me.  My roommate just started seeing someone she met off eharmony.  We both signed up at the same time for fun  and while I was rejected time and time again  she was SO picky and then started seeing the first guy she went out with.  I am happy that she found someone and she really deserves it  but I get so ANGRY that she is constantly doing things with him.  It's like I've been replaced.  I feel like a 5 year old for thinking that  but I just can't help how I feel.  Today  for example  I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie I had gotten off our digital cable.  We have it until 9 tonight and she said she'd like to.  I was pretty excited seeing as how I hadn't been invited to a couple of events this weekend in lieu of ZACH going.  Well  she just came down stairs and said that Zach is going to be  coming over now.  This ticks me off because she broke our plans  and I don't have a way to ""escape"" when they are here.  I'm sure she's going to want to watch that movie with Zach  and  I know I'm being selfish  but I don't WANT him here tonight.  I haven't gotten to see Angela all weekend and the one night we have before going back to work HE is going to be here.  So I have to put on my happy face and pretend that I am glad for her and happy that she has someone and engage him in conversation when all I will feel like doing is crying.  It's unfair!  Why does it seem like when you are depressed  everyone around you has these GREAT things happening in their life.  Angela just got a promotion  a new car  and now a new boyfriend.  I am stuck in the same job  same crushing car payment  and I haven't dated anyone in over 6 years. ",1
 I had a lousy night. I went to a street dance with my PARENTS  and was just so alone. I have been single for two months  and meeting new guys in my small town is so hard. I don't drink or do drugs  and that's all a lot of them do. I work an evening shirt at the local factory  and I can't seem to find anyone with the same interests and values as me. I'm really in to horses and the outdoors and everyone my age just seems to want to get drunk and party. I'm already depressed  and this whole thing is just not helping. I'm close to my parents  and I love spending time with them  but I'm afraid guys just see me as some loser who can't grow up or something. Does anyone have any advice on how to just meet people who aren't into parting? Does anyone else come from small towns with this same problem! Thanks bunches.  ,1
" this is my first post.  I am 27  5 and a half months pregnant dealing with depression / anxiety.  I have taken antidepressants off and on for a few years but stopped this summer because my husband and I were trying to conceive.  My pregnancy has been pretty rough this time around ... (I have an 8 year old son).  I've had joint problems  severe morning sickness ... and terrible depression / anxiety.  My husband just doesn't understand what I'm going through ... he thinks that I'm being hateful or sad on purpose.  He contributes to a lot of the way that I feel.  He told me early in the pregnancy  that if something was to happen and I lose the baby or it was born with something wrong with it  he would have a hard time not blaming me for it even if the doctor said that nothing could have prevented it.  This was said to me because I wasn't taking my prenatal vitamins at the time because of the morning sickness.  I could see if I were using drugs or drinking but I do not do those things.  I don't understand his thinking on that subject.  My mother in law is another person getting on my nerves.  She comes over uninvited and gives out unwanted advice.  She also has a way of making me angry with her thoughtless comments which are hurtful and unnecessary.  I can't talk to my husband about this because he would see me as the ""bad guy"".  Sometimes I just want to be alone ... away from people ... I feel like I don't have any privacy anymore.  My husband always makes me feel worse when I talk to him about how I feel.  I don't know why he aggravates me to talk to him then always says .... ""Well  you ought to be thankful ... rrblah rrblah rrblah"".  It isn't like I don't know that I could have it worse ... but he never cares what I feel at that moment.  I guess I better shut up ... I have ranted long enough ... although I feel like I could go on forever ... so sorry for the long post ... ",1
 I don't know what good being here will do but I NEED someone to talk to. I am so depressed that I am actually crying while I am typing this. I am a single mother of three (one lives with me). I have no job. I have a tremendous amount of clerical skills and am currently in college but I feel like the world is crashing down around me. I have been on Prozac since 1986 because of the loss of both my parents. I have no one to talk to  no friends  no family. I have no one to turn to. I up and left my last job because of a fight between my boss and I. If I get into conflict when I am depressed I run away from things. Now I can not get a job because when they call the job for references  they slam me. I get no child support for my son because if I go to file they will make me pay (I have no income at all except for money that I am able to borrow) my ex because he has two of my kids. (He makes a tremendous amount of money but won't even give me lunch money for our youngest son). I am at the bottom of the tunnel (been here for some time now) and can not see the light. I have been trying and trying to get a job but the door keeps being slammed in my face. I feel like crap and can't cope with it any more.,1
 This morning M finally confessed and now I know the truth: This IS summer here. I realize I spend a lot of time talking about food  the weather and nudity on this blog  but these seem to be re-occurring themes of my new life and  really -- what's more important than having nice food while naked in excellent weather? Not much  I say. So  despite the long arduous months of patiently awaiting the promised beauty of a Dutch summer  what I'm really getting is this: Virtually constant canopy of gray/black clouds? Check! Scarves and light jackets lest the freezing summer temperatures turn your nipples to stone? Check! Got your umbrella for sudden downpours that may or may not contain hail? Check Check! Surly attitude because you can't wear your pretty sandals (unless you like blue toes) and your boyfriend's been lying to you for months about the upcoming lekker warm weather? Check and check and check! Try to ignore that previous blog entry within which I detailed all the nice things about Holland at this time of year and the fact that the weather was oven-hot. Apparently  that was a freak of nature. Though I do still love the little lambs.,1
 Hi everyone! I've been trying to find something or someone to help me out depression for ages  but I'm not an open person and it's been very difficult for me. I was never happy with my life and been just running away from problems. I left home when I was 18 and went to London. I wanted to start new life  but moved 11 times since then and always hoped I'll be happy in the new place. But it's getting worse and worse  I'm back home now  and start to realize  that I have nowhere to run and I'm getting old for that. I had a best friend in London  but she just used me and left when my ex went to jail. I have no one to talk to and I found so difficult to find new friends. I never talk about my problems  just to myself  when I'm with people  I'm completely different person  I'm so shy and I hate it. I hate it when I want to say something  but my mind doesn't let me and I'm just upset on myself. I don't remember the morning  when I woke up with a good mood or without headache. I've been thinking so much  that even when I stop I still feel this horrible pain in my head. I tried to bring my confidence up with drugs  but they just made it worse and I feel even more depressed. I've been thinking everyday. What am I going to do? and what is the worse about all this is that when I decide something what I feel is right and in few hours or minutes I think about it again and my feelings change and change again. ...it's driving me crazy. I'm getting so sensitive on everything  I'm crying from watching a stupid cartoon  or listening to the music  I feel sick or strange high on everything I put in my mouth. I think I've lost myself  I can't see the point of life anymore. Suicide? I tried that  but now I'm afraid of death  I'm afraid of everything. I would be glad if I could find some friends here... at least one  who understand and could beat this depressive moods with me. Love  Angela  23 ,1
 I've had a rough time of things lately  which is partly what made me search for this site. I've had recurrent unipolar depression since my mid teens with an associated anxiety disorder and a panic disorder that took root 5 years ago after I beat a drink problem I had at the time (between the age of 22 and 25 I used alcohol as a bit of a crutch which was a huge mistake). Anyway these days I am teetotal  on anti depressants and only really get a bad time with my depression A during the winter months or B if something triggers an episode (circumstantial). Usually it lifts up in the summer months (I think I might get a bit of SAD) but last year my mother passed away on the 23rd of March and it caused a huge crash in my mood which never lifted in time before the winter episode took hold. I dealt with it by comfort eating (I do comfort eat at times  but I also get bad food cravings in the winter for foods such as chocolate  cheese and carbohydrates  so pizza and chocolate ice-cream became my regular fodder for a while). Anyway that lead to weight gain which is besides the point but which I was planning on correcting (as I have done before) this summer when the food cravings wear off and my mood lifted. Unfortunately it's not lifted as of yet due to recent circumstances. Not only did I have the first anniversary of my mother's death to deal with  but my partner whom I loved very much decided that this would be the best time to dump me and completely rip me to shreds in the process. He basically emailed (he lives in another city) a few days before the anniversary of her death saying he wanted to end it. I tried to contact him but he wouldn't talk on the telephone or by voice  and would not respond to any emails I sent him. He then contacted me by IM on the day of her anniversary (23rd March) to rip me to shreds and tell me that he couldn't love someone like me before posting publicly on his journal running me down before posting disturbing replies to some of the posts on my journal anonymously (but I recognized his ISP number so I know it was him even though he denied it) making it sound as though the whole thing was deliberate. I wouldn't mind but it came out of the blue  the night before all this started he was discussing a work transfer to move to where I am and signed off with 'I love you'. Next day  wham. I'm social phobic so don't really have many friends I cant talk to about this  my mother was usually the one id turn to but she isn't here anymore  so my mood  although it usually lifts at this time of year  has taken a nose dive and I'm having trouble getting myself motivated again. The emotional pain I felt on that Thursday was like nothing I had felt for years  I just literally felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. I couldn't sleep and I couldn't eat for the best part of that week  although I'm eating and sleeping again now. Am I over reacting to what he did  because I'm hurt as hell and completely and utterly infuriated with him at the same time? I know I can be slightly prone to being a bit of a drama queen at times (over reacting to stuff) and I can sometimes be a little paranoid. But the whole thing felt deliberate as though he intentionally intended to hurt me  and even now when I try to contact him to get answers he is being spiteful and running me down. Of course after this I spat a whole load of vitriol at him and now I'm being painted as the one that was in the wrong  and he is saying he did nothing that warranted the vitriol and is the innocent party in all of this. Of course he also interprets home truths as vitriol  and I tend to be very open and say things as I see them  to the point of lacking tact now and again. But whilst I'm willing to stand up and say I made a few mistakes and apologize  he is acting as though the blame is all mine and he did nothing wrong. I just can't seem to make him understand that the way he went about ending the relationship was one of the most hurtful ways anyone could have done it. I know he claims to suffer from bipolar disorder which he wont get treatment for  and I know that can make him highly moody  but I cant understand why he doesn't understand the hurt he caused me  or if he does  how someone who professed to love me  doesn't even seem to care. He seems totally and utterly cold  so cold it's chilling. I know he gets periods of emotional flatness because he told me  and he also told me he hears voices as well. Could he be suffering from some kind of depression related psychosis? One post he made to my journal was: Wisdom comes only to those who seek it  and sometimes to those who deserve it regardless of perfection  intent or even understanding. The common denominator though  seems to be deed. For one must do  or be done to  in order for wisdom to take root. Am I misreading that? Or reading into it? So am I over reacting? Was I wrong to argue back with him? How can I move on and get my motivation back again?,1
 I'm a 23 year old female who has suffered from depression for the last 3 years. I remember having bouts of it in high school  hating myself and thinking i was ugly and worthless  but it generally passed and things got better. Then all of a sudden when i was 20  i just started crying constantly  feeling out of control  wanting to dig a hole and bury myself  not knowing what to do with myself  feeling hysterical. I went on medication after a few months  and things improved  but it's something i still deal with every day.  I am at university full time  as well as working part time  and just feel like i'm constantly on the edge of going insane. I just moved to a new city  and feel so lonely  wanting attention but i feel like no one's interested. Worst of all  i miss so much university (because i can't get out of bed in the morning) that my tutors regard me as a bad student  which makes me feel so bad  because i know i'm smarter than most of the people in our class. I just want everyone to know i'm not lazy and boring  i just feel like my body is made of lead and i have no energy and no drive to get up in the morning. I have just started seeing a psychologist and she is really great  but it's so expensive i have to work extra shifts at work just to manage  which makes me even more stressed out!  I don't want to take time off university because i took last year off and it made me feel worse. I really love my course and it's pretty much the only thing that gives me joy ...  if only i could get out of bed to go!  i'm so angry at myself  my life wasn't meant to be like this... ,1
" Hi  I'm pretty sure I'm suffering from depression  and probably have been for the last 18 months or so. It's only been lately that I feel like the rug has really been jerked out from under me  though. I think it started in mid-2004 when I became seriously ill. Between June and September 2004  I spent three weeks in the hospital  umpteen visits to the E/R  and finally  major surgery to correct the problem. Physically  I'm fine now. But we had no health insurance (long story)  and when the hospital bills started rolling in  we tried our best to pay the bills  but there was just no way. We ended up filing bankruptcy  I lost my home business  and we very nearly lost our home. Ever since then  I've felt like I'm falling down a dark tunnel  even though the bankruptcy is over with. I was drinking part of this time  but have stopped  thinking that may have been causing the problem. But it's actually become worse since I've stopped.  Here's my ""symptoms"": I don't usually have trouble falling asleep  but I can't seem to stay asleep for more than a couple of hours. It's hard to go back to sleep  so I usually just get up. Weight gain because I find myself eating even when I'm not hungry. The ""comfort food"" thing  I guess. I tend to be a ""stress"" eater  and goodness knows I've had a lot of that lately! I used to enjoy camping and reading books (etc.)  but I don't care about any of that anymore. I couldn't sit down now and read a book no matter how much I wanted to. I get through 5 or 6 pages  and totally lose interest. That's depressing in itself  because I used to love reading so much. I have no desire to get out and do anything. I literally close myself up in my spare bedroom every waking hour  only coming out to use the bathroom and to fix supper for my husband. I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I'm not happy  but I can't pinpoint exactly what would make me happy. I honestly can't think of anything. I have no energy whatsoever.  I've been dealing with a TON of guilt over the bankruptcy. After all  the bankruptcy wouldn't have happened if I hadn't gotten sick  you know? I feel horrible for dragging my husband's credit down along with mine  but the way things were  I couldn't file bankruptcy by myself. Our credit was PERFECT until I got sick. My husband sold a bunch of his personal belongings to help pay bills  as did I  but it was so unfair for him to have lost his stuff on account of me. He's never once complained  but I still feel terrible. I've also been kicking myself for the loss of my home business. I can't help but feel like if it hadn't failed (I couldn't keep up with it during my illness)  that we wouldn't have had to file bankruptcy. I've never been a crier  but I sure feel like it sometimes. I can't seem to do anything ""right"" these days. Irritable!!! Throwing stuff  being unreasonable  getting mad about petty things. The one thing I haven't experienced (thankfully) is suicidal thoughts. A few random ""morbid"" thoughts here and there  but nothing I'd ever act on. Last night I took several online self-tests  and all of them said I had mild to moderate depression. One even said severe. I guess the next step would be to go to the doctor  but I don't have a doctor. My sister is taking Zoloft for panic attacks and a PMS disorder  so I guess I'll ask her who she's seeing. What do they do ... just ask questions similar to the online questionnaires? Or? I've been reading about all the different kids of medicines  and found the information about Wellbutrin to be the most interesting. Obviously the doctor would know what I need better than I would  but I sure don't want to take something that's going to make me gain even more weight or feel like a zombie. At least one good thing  though. We do  thankfully  have insurance now. Another issue is my husband and family. To them  depression is something that people should be able to ""just shake off"". They don't understand that I CAN'T seem to ""shake it off""  otherwise  I gladly would. My husband is supportive in other ways  but he scoffed when my sister started taking Zoloft. To them  if they can't ""see"" the problem  it doesn't exist. I'm sure they don't mean to be ""mean""  but they just don't understand. Sorry for rambling. Any suggestions or thoughts?",1
 How's it going  all who read. My name is Greg  I'm 19 and have had depression for basically as long as I remember. Here's a brief history of my journey through depression and the treatments I have endeavored. I began on lexapro. It seemed to be helping and then it quit on me (or perhaps vice versa). After that I tried zoloft  and wellbutrin  but to the same effect. Then I turned my world to narcotics (mainly  marijuana and DXM). They helped ALOT  but because they are illegal  I felt a constant public stigma and guilt. I couldn't take it  despite the amazing effects of both drugs. I'm now taking Paxil CR  but I'm going to quit it because it isn't working. I'm beginning to lose hope altogether. It seems apparent to me that SSRIs just aren't for me  or maybe I just haven't found the right one. The real problem with depression is that you have to wait a month on each drug just to see it it's going to work. Those months can feel like years. Anyways  that's who I am. I hope to make a few friends here  and a lot of advice as well. Does anyone one else share these symptoms (if so  and if you think you can help contact me please): Chronic fatigue  lack of motivation/desire  inability to enjoy life  insomnia (including the other obvious and supplementing symptoms) The real killer is I know I have the potential to be someone great  but I have to become happy first...Greg,1
" Nice to see you too!!! How are you today? I think you really have hit the mark on what I was trying to express with this question - all the negativity and darkness that is contained in almost every media outlet you can name. The disasters you mention  such real human tragedy but the way the media went after it was appalling and seemed to be muddled in politics and ratings. As for those forensic shows - ugh! I used to be able to watch them but way before this recent ""episode"" of mine I stopped. I couldn't stand the heartache of knowing what evil lurks out there. Where I work now one of the first friends I made was a gentleman who has since retired. He told me that he didn't read the news  watch TV or listen to the radio (except for light jazz) because he found that to do so was just too much pain  it did not ""serve"" him to subject himself to that kind of pain. He seemed to be generally very happy and upbeat to me so there must be something to it. As for your friend - that's a tough one but maybe since she is your friend she might understand if you explain to her how incredibly painful her TV choices are on you. Does she ever read or post here? Anyway  it is GREAT talking with you again and I look forward to the next chat. I hope you have a wonderful day and weekend.",1
" Yep - I know this all too well. And it is a sad state of affairs. But you are aware of it. Best you know what is going on than be surprised. SN  I hear what you are saying about not being able to weather another strike against your stability now. And I hope you do not have to go. I will pray with you that you are spared from the cuts this time  but while you are praying and hoping  consider the issue of your personal power. If you are feeling shaky in other areas of life  I doubt that you feel that you have any. I have been in that situation over many things. Remember the difference between what you DO have control over and what you do NOT have control over: you can control the way you approach this job  your punctuality  your diligence  your politeness to other workers; you CANNOT control the decisions made on the top and how they will affect your status. I have been reading a book called ""Corporate Confidential"" by Cynthia Shapiro. She was an HR manager for her whole life and spills the beans on how companies decide who will stay and who will go. It was an eye-opener for me. Perhaps it can help you at this juncture. In your own prayers  remember to ask God not just for the optimal decision to be made on your behalf  but for the power to see where you do and do not have control and for help taking charge of the areas that you actually can control. When you are in a phase of instability  it seems that more and more garbage gets thrown your way. But a turning point comes when the indignation of being tossed on everyone else's sea propels you into action. That turning point came for me about 9 years ago when a really awful roommate had to be ejected. I felt a power I had never felt before - the ability to take charge of my own life  not waiting for someone else's decision to tell me whether I was going to be OK or not. I am trying to find my way back to that point. I hope you do too. It can happen.",1
"  I'm new here - left an introductory ramble in the appropriate section.  I've been depressed (both clinically recognized or otherwise) for around 15 years (I'm 20 for the record).  After 3 - 4 months of a ""good"" period I'm finding that I'm slipping back into that ""black hole"".  I'm looking for support and very happy to offer everyone all I have to help  even if it's little.  I haven't been to a therapist in 2 years and I've not been on medication steadily for an even longer while (although I think I needed both in the meantime save for the past few ""happy"" months).  Anyway - take care everyone.  I know I'm new here but if anyone feels like they're cracking up  feel free to PM me. I'm used to the unpleasant ride depression gives people. ",1
 I've posted a few times on these forums and everyone has always been so helpful and supportive  so I'm hoping I can get some help with this.  For the last few weeks  my depression has been so horrendous  worse than it's ever been  that I have not been able to go to work.  I keep calling in sick  and then when I can finally make myself go  I hide in the bathroom crying or go to an empty office (not in my cubicle) and call my mother and cry to her.  I've been in touch with my pdoc  who is in the process of passing me off to another doctor.   Granted  it's at my request  as he is not on my insurance.  However  he's not willing to put me on any other types of medications since he won't be seeing me regularly.  I've spoken to my long - time pdoc from Dallas  my hometown  and he knows me very well.  I trust him more than any other doctor  which is not saying much  but he says that I'm unipolar  aka major depressive disorder  and a mood stabilizer would be the next best thing to try since all the antidepressants are not working.  (was taking 30mg celexa  just upped to 40mg when this all started.)  I'm seeing a new pdoc that's covered by my insurance on Monday  so maybe things will move forward.  Ok  so back to the work thing.  My supervisor is not sympathetic to my problem.  In all fairness  I have not told her details.  I find that most people do not consider mental disease a real medical problem.  She suggested that I talk to Human Resources about taking some type of leave if I don't know when I'll be better.  I'm working on that and hoping one of these doctors will sign for me.  The biggest problem I have is the guilt over missing work.  I never imagined that the depression could get so bad that I couldn't just suit up and show up.  That's been my motto every time things get rough.  I guess I'm looking for validation here.  If I really do have it in my to get to work  I certainly can't find it.  I'm a very responsible person  so this is not like me.  The only time I've ever called in sick is when I was having depression issues  but never more than one day.  Everyone gets a sick day  and I never get the flu or anything  so I don't feel guilty about those days.   What do I do?  Am I looking at this the wrong way?  It's so hard to be objective when you are so low.  My saving grace is that my parents (who are far away in Dallas) are being the most supportive people in the world.  They believe me when I say I just can't get to work  since that's not like me  but that's not like them either  so I know they want me to get there if I can.   Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this.  I'm hoping someone else has gone through it and can help. ,1
 Just a little update - my temporary $8 an hour job was the foot in the door I needed. Two weeks later and I'm on day one of a higher paying  with benefits  permanent job with these people. Granted it's still in the same agency as my last job down here  but different division. It's good though that I can just walk down the street during lunch and have lunch with the girls from my old office. I did miss them and their good gossip. By my birthday in September we'll all be in the same building  we move in August and they do on my birthday  so that'll be fun! While I was pregnant I was sure I'd want to be a stay at home mom. After having Toby I thought I did then as well... 6 months later and I was dying to get out of the house and back to work. I do miss him but I don't envy my husband's job of taking care of him and the house and our pacifier business while I get rest at work. I get to have lunch  take my time and go to the bathroom when I need to  and talk to real adults about non baby stuff in non baby speak. And the best part - I'm getting out of the house! And I have a reason to not wear pajamas all day. I also really do appreciate my time with Toby more. I don't see it as a chore anymore. Phew.,1
 Hi  after 2 posts on the DF I'm finally beginning to work out the format. Excuse the typo's as going through Prozac withdrawals and kind of shaky! I'm 27 years old  I live in the UK  Studied psychology  trained psychiatric nurse  behavior family therapist  and trainee CB therapist. Not sure if I can go back to my CBT course as I have missed so much time from university due to my current episode. This is my worst episode ever. I have had depression for 8 years  and have been ashamed and embarrassed by it. As my life seems to be ebbing away  I have come out with it and seeking psychiatric help. My problem has been that I work in psychiatry and have feared loosing my job/career. It means everything to me. It's the only thing I have and couldn't bare seeing it go down the toilet. Friends don't understand and know how to discuss the topic with me. My family doesn't know as it would devastate an already broken family. For 8 years I've suffered in silence  cried silent screams  been tormented by my own brain. I hate imagining living a life like this especially when the long term effects I'm reminded of every day (my patients). The only person I had was my ex girlfriend  we split last year. CAUSE? me. Stress got the better of me  my thinking became screwed and I've lost her  for life. She was the only one I could talk to  some one I had known for  12 odd years. Depression has ruined my life. This episode has been an eye opener. This is the first time planet earth is hearing about my struggle. Something  which may have otherwise been lost. My secrets buried with me. Don't confuse this as a suicide note. It isn't. It's me talking about things in this way for the first time. I'm over the crisis point but nowhere near my usual self and need to sort my medicines out with my doctor as soon as possible. I've had a brave chat with my boss who is going to sort out a psychiatrist in the next 10 days  all being well. I have only taken one OD in 1998 with a serious intent to kill myself. Doctors said I survived as I woke up. For years I've avoided talking about it  never wanted to see a psychiatrist but realize now (well for now) that there is 2 people inside me. One is me  the other is depression and to stand the best chance of staying well and keeping well then I need to face I have a problem. Around 3 weeks ago I was so actively suicidal  I was thinking of jumping off a bridge into the river  i searched the internet for ways to kill myself. I'm out of that acute phase but don't trust myself. I have tried SSRIs but they just don't agree with me so it looks like I'm going back on Mirtazapine. I stopped taking it sometime ago as I put on weight. Since last year I've lost 2 stone through diet and exercise. In the last 3 weeks I've lost 4 lbs as a result of depression. Right now my mind's blank. I've never chatted to anyone on this forum before but I know you guys know what I'm going through. My life has never been the same since 1998. It never will be. My dad died in 2002 since then things have worsened. I have so much to say I could write on but going to leave it for now. You guys are the first to hear my full (well pretty full) story. I have never had the courage to speak like this before. Bye for now,1
" I am a 42 year old woman who is single and has no one ""special"" in my life.  I am becoming my disgusted with my life and where I am.  I really want to make 2006 my year.  Yes I have said that every year since I turned 18.  I am at the lowest point that I didn't want to reach.  I am afraid to sink any lower.  I am currently on effexor and linispril.  Effexor is started to have a negative effect on my heath  but I am so afraid of returning night terrors that I'm afraid to allow my doctor to change it.  I am seeing a counselor but he isn't working on my cognitive behavior.  I need someone to tell me positive things and to help me believe that I am not bad.  He just seems to repeat what I say.  I had someone before who focused on my thought patterns and it helped greatly.    ",1
 Hello Tommy! to DF! I'm glad you joined! This board is a great place for information and support. Take your time browsing through the topics. I'm sure there will be lots of things you can relate to. When you feel comfortable enough  feel free to share any of your thoughts  questions  concerns  experiences  etc...Congrats on taking your first steps towards recovery! I think it takes a lot of courage to start treatment. I know it took me quite a while to admit to myself I couldn't handle my situation on my own any longer. I think you did great starting on both talk therapy and medicines! I hope you find therapy useful and that you and your therapist can work towards better skills to cope with the stressors in your life. Concerning your medication. There's a room dedicated to your antidepressant Prozac. You'll find lots of information there. Check it out sometime. One of the downsides of antidepressants is the fact that it takes a while for them to kick in. You only started about 10 days ago so you'll have to give the Prozac some time to be able to fully benefit from it. Meanwhile I hope you're not having too many side effects! Tom  thanks for joining. Keep us posted on how you're doing! Take good care of yourself!  ,1
 I joined yesterday and have been reading through some of the posts. Thought I had better introduce my self.  I live in the UK.  Looking back on my life I think I have always had depression. It got worse though  3.5 years ago after the birth of my son. I though i had PND at the time. I was always crying  felt really low and would panic if I was left alone with the baby. It put a huge strain on my marriage and lots of arguments because my husband though I had gone off him. I went back to work put couldn't cope  lack of motivation etc. but like someone said below I put on a 'happy face' to make people think that I was OK. I muddled through for a year then went to see a GP who put me on Prozac. Stupid me came off it after 2 months thinking I was OK. Slowly the depression came back  I wasn't coping with my job  the simplest tasks at work and at home were impossible to face  I couldn't concentrate or make decisions. Last Spring it all got too much. I was getting up crying every morning  I became agoraphobic. I phoned in work and said i couldn't go in. I saw the GP and went on Prozac. I took 2 months off work. I stayed on Prozac until last September. And then  guess what  it all came back with a vengeance a few months ago. This time I was also feeling suicidal which really scared me. So I am now back on the Prozac and determined to stay on it.  I think I have generalized depression made worse by circumstances. The birth of my son  trying to keep a job down and be a Mom  and my husband. Last year my husband really turned to alcohol and ended up ill in hospital. He has been on incapacity benefit ever since  so our relationship and our finances have really suffered. He has changed to. Even though he says he loves me he gets angry a lot  shouts at me  criticizes me  puts me down. I don't know how much more of it I can take  without leaving him. I make excuses for him  that it is his illness and lack of earning power that make him like that but it is no excuse to turn me into a nervous wreck who is scared to say anything in case he shoots me down. The Prozac has reduced but not removed my depression and I still have the odd day where I want to run away. I keep thinking 'will it go away if I leave my husband?' I no longer love him but life has dealt a difficult blow to us both recently and maybe one day when the stresses have been removed I will love him again.  Anyway that's my story (sounds similar to Vanyas who i have PM'd). ,1
" I'm 29  female and i live in the UK. My background with depression is that i started suffering from it significantly when i was 18 and have been on various antidepressants since. I've recently come off Effexor (venlafaxine) after about 5 years of being on it  at mostly the 150 mg dose  and this has been the only antidepressant that's properly helped me. Two months ago i decided to come off it  as id been wanting to at least lower the dose i was taking  for some time. Also my doctors surgery are now ""funnier"" about prescribing it to new patients because of the reports of heart murmurs among some patients. I've been taking citalopram  at either 20 mg or 40 mg but i don't really like these medications and after this month is up I'm hoping to come off them  either to go on something else or to stop taking antidepressants altogether  those are my options. But the truth is ..... and my doctor is wondering as well .... what medications would i go on next? I've felt pretty rotten lately and the citalopram has done little for me except negative stuff  it makes me want to just take the venlafaxine again!  Any thoughts  comments or suggestions would be most welcome!! ",1
 I'm 19 and I go to school full - time (or try to) and work part - time. I usually end up having a breakdown sometime during the middle of the semester and have to drop either all or most of my classes. In two years I've only completed 27 credits and I feel like a total failure. I struggle through the semester even when the classes are not that difficult. I just have a hard time focusing  concentrating and simply maintaining an interest in my classes. I just feel like an idiot and a failure sometimes because others my age are so much further along than me and I feel if I could just make myself focus more  I would be too. When I am able to concentrate  I do well but it's so rare that I am able to concentrate. On top of all that  I hate my job. It fills me with dread anytime I even think about having to go. I just feel overwhelmed sometimes and I feel like I'm not going to amount to anything in life. I started medications at the end of May but so far they haven't kicked in yet. Is anyone else having this problem with school??,1
" Oh yeah!!! I am 52  perimenopausal and on EffexorXR and the occasional chlorazapate. I could NOT figure out why all of a sudden I was feeling so much worse shaky  can't sleep/want to sleep all the time. Then a ping went off in my head and I went ""Duh!"" I had stopped taking the hormones 5 weeks ago and have been in a gradual downward spiral since. It just didn't get bad or noticeable till last weekend. Called my GYN and told her the hormone reduction experiment was a total failure. I'm going for a new hormone today. I have heard that very low dose BC pills can help if the PMDD gets really bad.",1
 I seem to have depression the worst  first thing in the morning lately.  Just started with a new pdoc after 7 months. with another pdoc since this latest episode occured.  My old pdoc thought I could have a mild bipolar disorder but wasn't sure.  My 20 mg of prozac had stopped working after several years of keeping me stable.  She started me on lamictal and I am now up to 100 mg / day.  Stopped the prozac in early January and got worse  but not right away.  I was having a good week / bad week type pattern depending on where I was in my menstrual cycle while I was on the prozac.  I have battled depression on and off for 20 years.  Particularly bad postpartum and this recent episode.  I am 41 years old and haven't felt this bad since I had my daughter 8 years ago.   My new doctor thinks I don't have an ounce of bipolar and that I am just in a depression (I tend to agree with her).  We decided together to add Lexapro to the mix and see if that helps me level out all the days of the month.  I have been on it almost 2 weeks patiently waiting for some results - I am well aware of the waiting game.  I am also taking Xanax XR in the evenings for sleep and to avert morning anxiety.  I take my Lamictal in the morning and a very small (half of the lowest dose of xanax) as well.  I seem to get moving and can be quite productive during my day after I take the Lamictal / xanax - don't know if this is a placebo effect??  My question is  has anyone experienced this a.m. depression that seems to lift a bit later in the day?  Also  does anyone take Lamictal for unipolar depression?  The last thing I want is to be taking too much of anything and further putting off good health.  Starting to wonder if the Xanax XR in the evening is giving me this early morning dread?? ,1
" Whatever happened to Doctor - patient confidentiality???  I applied for short term disability because depression is affecting my job and I am barely function - able at work. The insurance company made me sign a waiver of privacy to both my therapist and psychiatrist.  Now they can call them up and ask anything they want!!  The insurance company called me yesterday for a telephone ""interview""! They wanted me to explain why I needed the time off  what my symptoms are  how long have I been like this  really personal questions .......  They are going to be the ones who determine whether I can get disability pay or not! Whatever happened to just taking the word of the doctor??  I wonder who the insurance company can tell? I forgot to ask them if this is going to be kept confidential.  They also asked how this is affecting my job  I felt if I gave the ""wrong"" answer  they will decide not to pay me.  I wonder what they are going to ask my shrinks  and how much info the shrinks can give them.  Also  I understand that the shrinks / therapists can break the confidentiality rule if you threaten to hurt yourself or another --- that I can understand  but if you are ever on trial for something they can subpoena the doctors and they have to tell ALL!  That is ridiculous!  What happens if I am just a witness to some crime  but did not do the crime.  What happens if the lawyers want to discredit me so they put my shrink on the stand to ask what a nut I am?  Just ranting  but opinions  feedback would be appreciated. ",1
 I am 20 year old female. I have been on numerous antidepressant and anxiety medicine since I was 11 years old. I never had a problem with sexual dysfunction because 1) I had never been in a serious relationship  2) I had never been sexual with someone. Now that I am in a sexual  serious relationship  I am having problems. I believe this is a result of Lexapro. I have never had a problem orgasming (at least not to this extent) and I have been on Zoloft  Prozac  you name it  etc. (These medicines were changed because they were either making me too drowsy or simply weren't working). During the summer  I was only on Wellbutrin and had no problem orgasming. However  due to overwhelming anxiety during the start of the school year  I started taking Lexparo and continued the Wellbutrin. Ever since I added Lexapro  I have had an EXTREMELY delayed orgasm  or no orgasm at all. It is really frustrating.  My doctor suggested switching medicine  but since Lexapro is working so well for me as far as anxiety goes  I said I'd rather not. I can't lower my dose because I am on the starting dose for both Wellbutrin and Lexapro. He said I could switch to Effexor or another SSRI medicine  but I may have the same sexual dysfunction.  I was just wondering if anyone here has had a successful combination of Wellbutrin plus an anxiety medication that didn't cause such extreme sexual dysfunction. ,1
 All I am on this earth for is to die. What is so great about living. Everyone is going to die eventually. Why wait? Just get it over with. If god is so fucking great then why does he put humans on the earth that feel lost  sad  lonely  depressed  and worthless? Why do we all feel this way if god is wonderful? FUCK GOD! We're all in this world to eventually die. I want out. I hate the world  i hate myself  i hate the sun  i hate the moon  i hate everyone i know  i hate hating  but worst of all i hate love. when i love someone why don't they love me back? when i trust someone why must they lie to me? WHY?!?!?! Why is the world the way it is? why am i the way i am? Why are there so many worthless  hopeless  depressed people in the world that they have to make web sites?? Why is this the only way and the only time i can ever share my feeling? Why am i depressed? Do you want to know? ............... because i got raped and abused for 8 years. because i had my childhood taken away from me by a person that i trusted my life with  by the person that i called my father. My step dad raped me for 8 years  since i was 8 years old until a few months ago. Why didn't i tell anyone? why couldn't i speak up? ..... because he told me they wouldn't believe me  it would ruin the family. my mom would hate me. well he was right about one thing it did ruin the family  but they did believe me and my mom still loves me. it ruined the family for a better cause. i don't ever have to see or talk to my step dad ever again. so why do i still feel this way?. ...... because my mom still loves him  she is torn between us and she never really took my side and helped me through this. For 8 years of my life i had to pretend to be happy and normal. i had to push everything in the back off my mind and cry every night. i had to wonder why he was doing this to me  i thought he loved me. He had been my father since i was 2. how could he betray me like this and hurt me. how could he take away my childhood. from that i learned that in the end everything will be bad and nothing is ever what it seems. I had to grow up so fast  i had to realize how the world really was. i had to lie and keep secrets. I learned to hide everything even myself  even my soul. It took me 8 years of pain and suffering. of growing  thinking and knowing. of wishing  hoping and dreaming. to finally speak up. To finally show myself. to make my soul vulnerable. To cry a million tears that i could never cry before. but now that i can be me and show myself  i don't like myself. All the pain and misery. the secrets and lies. the memories and nightmares. this all was building up inside of me for 8 years. Now its showing and I'm a bitter and sad person. I was on the verge of exploding and now its taking me along time to get all this build up out of me. I've never really discovered who i really am. I pretended for 8 years and now all the hurt and bitterness is showing. When and if that's all gone what will i really be like? i can't even picture myself being happy or excited. I can't picture my self in color when everything around me including me is gray and bleak. Will anyone ever love me? I try to love people but they always hurt me and i know that it will always be that way .......................................................,1
 I'm 17 years old I live in the metro Detroit area and I have had depression for the past 5 years  my parents refuse to admit I have a problem  at one point I used to cut myself and at another point I was rushed to the ER to get my stomach pumped from trying to over dose. Basically I joined this forum so I can realize for myself I'm not the only one with problems. My depression has gotten a lot better over the years as certain situations got better too; I have a loving boyfriend whom I have been with for 14 months now  which I'm extremely sure that he has helped me. Next year  well in the fall I will be moving away to college  which I actually think will be a good thing for me. I am also a cheerleader at my school  which doesn't help with my depression I am constantly under pressure about that. I'm also a dancer  my parents have this thing where they like to find every little thing I do wrong. It seems as if nothing I do is good enough or right. Which has lead to my wanting to be alone and not eating. With the stress of dance and cheerleading and my parents constantly telling me I'm fat has lead me to only eat once or twice every other day. I know it is not healthy and I know it is not good  but I personally think its better then cutting and better then trying to overdose on pain killers and every other pill in the house. Thanks for listening.,1
" I know life isn't easy but I never knew it would be this hard... :( I feel empty and numb  but at the same time so sad and hurt... My biggest struggle is with my family  the only person that is there for me is my Step Dad... No one else seems to get it? My mum is always telling me to not keep secrets and that I should tell her how I feel coz if she doesn't know everything how can she help me? But I don't want to have to tell her everything (Because she says hurtful things back at me once I tell her and she won't even hug me) but if I don't tell her she makes me feel so bad and so I do tell her how I feel and then she shoots me down! She tells me to snap out of it and just get on with it and to stop being so stupid... every time I talk to my mum I cry coz she hurts me so much! And then she gets all down coz she makes me down which makes me down!!! I JUST CAN'T WIN! These days I only have to say something like ""oh that sucks  no milk"" and she tells me to get over it or get lost! And all I did was say something. I can't even really explain it? It's like she won't be happy until she hears what she wants to hear... I have tried talking to her about the way she makes me feel and all I get is ""that's just life"" or she starts telling me how she buys me things and that I should feel like this coz she has brought me things and let me use her car  etc  etc... The other day I was haven a really bad day and I asked mum for a hug and all she could say is ""No..."" she says she doesn't want to feed my sadness BUT instead of doing happy things she just tells me to get over it! And she won't listen when I say stop...She even told me to pack my bags and leave once if I didn't get over whatever it was I was going through! If I didn't have my step dad I wouldn't be here today... I love him more than the world and he is the only one that shows me that he loves me... I just need help... I don't want to be like this but then there are days when I love to feel sad and hurt.",1
 I'm actually feeling a little bit like a fraud at the moment  because I've read so many different topics today and realized that there are people who have suffered far more than I have. I've joined this site  to start to try and get some help for myself and to talk about the things that have caused me to feel like this over the last few years. My doctor has told me that I'm depressed and prescribed tablets  but I refuse to believe this and have not taken them. I know that this is wrong  but I hate the idea of being labeled depressed. Before I went to university  I was happy  adventurous  nothing could keep me down. I was in a fantastic relationship  but then I moved into halls  in a flat with six others  who I absolutely adored. One of them in particular  who I fell in love with. Little did I know that he had also fallen for me in the same way  but we were both so shy and I was in a relationship  that neither of us did anything about it ...... until we moved into a house together in our second year with 3 others. This is when everything went wrong. We were always close  really close in fact  and I admitted to him that I kept getting urges to kiss him  hold him and never let him go. He felt the same way as I did  but still nothing was done by either of us. Then one evening we were both out  getting drunk with friends  we found ourselves alone when we got back to the house and kissed. I've never felt like I did that night since. I didn't care about anything around me. We were the only 2 people in the world at that moment. The next morning  we were both a bit bemused and didn't know what to say / do  so pretended like nothing had happened. The end of term came and we had just moved in to another house with the same people  but were all going home for the summer. I was devastated knowing that we wouldn't see each other until september. I began to resent my boyfriend who I was still with and my family were going through problems because of my father. When september came  I went straight onto my final teaching placement  which meant up at 530 work all day  home  eat  work and then in bed by 11pm. I was tired all the time and didn't have the energy to go out in the week  but He was always there for me  and yes  we were still pretending like nothing had happened. After the christmas of my final year  I decided to party like never before. It was great  but there was still the issue of him. By now I had been trying to convince myself that I was still in love with my boyfriend  purely because I didn't have the guts to leave him and be on my own. How pathetic was that. Anyway  we went out to the union for a major drinking session  danced like a couple  felt like a couple  got back to the house and one thing led to another. We ended up sleeping together in his room  he initiated it. It was amazing. However the next day we were so confused that we didn't speak for 2 days  until I told him how I really felt. That I had been in love with him since my first year  but couldn't do anything about it  that I was going mad inside because I wanted him so much. He returned my feelings. From then on  we were inseparable  but to anyone who saw us together  we were just 2 very very close friends  who lived in each others' pockets. We were having an affair of sorts and living a lie  but we found comfort in each other and couldn't let it go. I know how wrong it was  believe me I do  and I would be devastated if it ever happened to me. We left university in the june of 2004. It was the worst time of my life. I felt like I was losing part of me  and was never going to get it back. Before we left and before the lie really started  I had agreed to move in with my boyfriend in leeds for his final year. I didn't want to do this anymore  but was too chicken to say no  so this went ahead and for the last year  july 04 until now  I have been living with my boyfriend. Things have not been good and I have still been seeing Him (from university) as often as I can. The most recent one was a couple of days ago. We have both joked about running away  children  marriage  but neither of us has got the guts to do anything. It is so wrong and has made my life so difficult  putting on a brave face for friends and family  pretending that I'm happy all of the time. I don't think I can do it much longer. One last thing  while all of this was going on in my life  my dad was causing mayhem at home. I was being pushed and pulled between the 2 people that I thought could get through anything and that were truly in love. How wrong can you be. I was like a piece of meat being fought over by 2 animals. They constantly bitched about each other to me  leaving me with no - one to talk to. I found myself being dragged further and further down in to a pit which I can't get out of. I'm in love with Him  but will not leave my boyfriend for fear of being alone  I resent my father for what he has done  I resent my mother for being callous  there is no - one that I have told this to over the past 4 years  nobody who I felt that I could really trust. I don't know what to do anymore. I cry at the smallest thing  hate things changing at all  but most of all  I can't see the point of going on anymore. I just want these feelings to end. My one savior has been my work  teaching children. caring for others and helping them make the most of their lives makes me feel like I'm doing something worthwhile. I'm not expecting any replies  I just needed someone / thing to listen. ,1
 I have dealt with depression since I was about 12 years old and am now 26. I can tell that it is getting worse again and feel as if I am losing the battle. I feel as if I have no where to turn. My medication is not working the best and I am at the max dosage. I do not want to start over with another med and all the side effects. I am hoping that it will get better soon. I do the best I can. I have a husband and 2 children. My husband tries but does not really understand depression. We have talked about it some but does not seem to help much. I was hoping someone might have some advice for me.,1
 I'm new here. I had been having a lot of problems with anxiety/depression and that was affecting my job a lot. I went out of work for a week hoping that maybe that would help. I felt like I was doing ok and that the relaxing was really helping but the night before I was supposed to go back to work it all happened again. So I pretty much came to the realization that I can't do it without medicines. Is this normal to think you are ok and then have it happen again?? And also  have any of you had your jobs affected by it?,1
" I would love to talk about dreams. Only thing is for every dream  there can be a hundred interpretations. Or so has been my experience. I always say that I will keep paper and pen next to me at night  so when I have a dream I want to remember (like last night)... I'll write it down so I won't forget. But I don't do this because when I wake up I think I can remember...no problem! After all  a lot of these dreams are so profound that how could I possibly forget them... guess what??? I almost always forget the words that meant so much to me in the dream. I remember the subject matter  but it's the words many times that I want to remember. So here goes my dream from last night (or early this morning)... A little background first for those who don't know or remember who I am... my mother died quite suddenly from her leukemia in April 2004. We were at odds with each other at the time. I started taking care of my elderly father at the time and he died this past August 2005. I've been wanting to dream about my mother and feel her presence and love since she died. I've only had a few dreams about her  maybe 4... And they have all been upsetting  never ""nice feeling"" dreams. Last night I had a dream of my mother. She was pregnant and ready to deliver her baby. She looked younger (she was almost 82 at her death) but in the dream ""we"" knew she was older like she was alive today. She said ""I'm ok now I'm going to have a baby At least I think this is what she said. My dad was in my dream as was my dad's cousin  who is also deceased. My mother's cousin-in-law was in the dream and she was sobbing. This same woman was crying out of control at my mother's funeral. We were at a hotel in Disneyland. Ok everyone. What does this mean?",1
" Messed up right now...not drunk or anything. Bt I feel like my brain has abandoned me these past few days. Can't think straight...Too disoriented. What was I thinking....?! Maybe it worked out before because we never went that far...But now... Fate's dropping me far too many signs that this isn't going to work out the way I expected it to. I remember how I told Freida how I hate set-ups like that because I get attached too quickly. That it's never just... never just that. My stupid heart confuses intimacy for affection too many damned times. No  don't freak out. It's not love that I'm going crazy about. It's our friendship. And you said we weren't compromising anything. I can't believe I agreed when in truth my whole brain was flashing the word ""FRIENDSHIP"" in font number 40  red fill with ten thousand exclamation points. I can't lose you as a friend. It's happened too many times to me and... No  not again. Not you. We've known each other for what? 17 years? Losing you once was enough. Damn it. How stupid of me. And they say sex is the quickest way to ruin a friendship. Damn.",1
" Hey Wurtle's back! For the record I disagree and think John Howard made an excellent choice  all his decisions are excellent. I cannot be held responsible for the ranting of a turtle.

" No one has a monopoly on suffering.  We keep living our lives because depression is pain and illness is suffering  but both don't happen without something happening to us. It is at these times that we are changing in some way...Suffering can give us greater empathy and understanding.  It can strip away all the other stuff.  So many say they will always be depressed ... that may or may not be the case but everyone has right to live their lives ... suffering included.  However  there is a vast difference between simply suffering from depression and finding the courage to live with long term / cyclical depression.  You can  learn to live with depression.  It may profoundly change your life ... take much away from you  but you can learn to live with it.  Long term depression isn't static ... like any illness  it changes.  But we know depression is different because it so cruelly takes away our hope of a brighter future.  But be stubborn and it will change again. To state in a forum like this  that you want to end it all is a big responsibility to place on the shoulders of other people.  It hands the possibility of that personal choice on to others .... which is unfair. Genuine suffering can bring more empathy and awareness of the plight of others in similar situations. There are times when i feel like ending my life and the thoughts nudge at me constantly but I recognize them now for what they are: the depression talking.  With each episode I have learnt new ways to try and tag these thoughts.  Ultimately ... the illness is happening to me / the thoughts happen to me.  But I would not burden others with the knowledge of their presence.  It is only afterwards that i might mention that i had these constant thoughts  because to tell them in the middle of the depression would only darken their lives as much as the depression is darkening my own. Please think before you make threats of suicide in the chat room or forums.  There is an increasing number of people using this technique of gaining attention but it is unfair.  by all means we can talk about it .... but saying : ""i'm going to do it."" is simply selfish and smacks of attention seeking. Such behavior is destroying the integrity of genuine sufferers of depression in the eyes of so many.  It is eroding the help which is so lacking for so many ... and is probably the reason why the mental health hospital near me is a relic from the 60's and yet the cancer department is brand new and state of the art. Please .... stop attention seeking and stop using ""depression"" as a convenient coat hanger for emotional immaturity and lack of personal responsibility. For so many people ... this really is a matter of life and death. ",1
 I found out  I  had depression about 10 years ago. But looking back I had it since i was a teen.  I've tried suicide about 4 times. As you can see that didn't work.  I have 2 kids  one is 21 and the other is 14. I've been married for 11 years this year. They know I have depression  but it's my problem not theirs. I wake up every morning thinking about killing my self and I go to bed thinking about killing myself. I sit around and cry all day. I don't like to leave my house  and I don't unless I really have to. I am overweight  39  and very alone in this world. My family tries to stay away from me  they don't talk to me unless they have to. My 14 year old is totally afraid of me  I can see it in her eyes. My 21 year old is bipolar  which makes him more screwed up than I am. He throws me into a panic attack every time I get around him. I have been on all of the medications out there  nothing seems to work for me. They just make me sleep a lot. I went to therapy for about 7 years. That really didn't work either. I just started back last month. I hope it helps me this time. ,1
" This may not be the right place for me to write but I just had to write somewhere.  I have not been clinical diagnosed depressed but I am not feeling ""happy"" right now.  I just can't seem to get over that my son's father  who left us 4 years ago  has a new family with a younger girl and another child on the way.  I can't seem to get myself out to meet to new people.  I know that I am the really the only one that can make things better for me.  I don't feel connected here where I am living.  I feel like I am missing out on something.  I just don't feel wanted anymore.  The only thing that I am glad about right now is that my son's father is finally caught up on child support.  Am I crazy  depressed or just plain stupid?",1
 Alright  this is a bit weird to explain  but I am having a lot of trouble making this decision so I am going to try and write it down. If anyone has any suggestions or advice to offer I would appreciate it. A while back my brother and I let a stray cat in and fed it  and we got really attached to it. It is probably the most needy animal I have ever met and will sit with people all day  loves it when you pet it  and I really like the cat. I wasn't thinking at the time  but later I realized I needed to pay a pet deposit like the rest of the people in my complex  so I could keep the cat. So my mother called up our landlord's office and they said that we could not have the cat. It seems really unfair to me that everyone else is allowed animals  but for some reason we are not. I don't think there is anything I can do about this and it makes me really sad. We didn't want to get rid of the cat so bad that we decided to hide the cat away  letting it inside only at night  and living in my brother's van in the day while we were looking to see if there was somewhere else we could move to. The problem is  I think I would only barely have enough money to move and I think it would be too risky that my family would lose our assistance if we were to go through with such a thing. Not to mention that I keep my spare money around in the case of emergencies and if something bad were to happen  I wouldn't be able to deal with it financially. So the only option I know of that is left is the animal shelter and I really do not want my cat to be locked up and possibly die alone in a cage. I know that it is getting old and that people take younger cats from animal shelters much more often than older ones. I want my cat to have a good place to live and don't want it to spend its final years in a cage  without loving owners. I am having so much trouble making this decision... I love my cat a lot and want it to be taken care of well and to be happy  but I am endangering my family the longer I try to hide it. My mother and brother keep telling me that it is my decision to make and I just keep procrastinating. So I posted this here because it is making me depressed and stressed out. Are there any options I am leaving out? Do I either have to spend all of my money to move or give it to an animal shelter? They both seem like such terrible options,1
" Hey  I guess this is the place to post this. I don't really know if I'm depressed and if I am I'm not sure how to go about getting help for it so I figured you guys would be able to help me out a bit. For the past year and a bit I've been feeling really out of sorts  pretty down and kind of lost in general. I left school in July 2004 and started a year out before I went to university. That's when I started feeling strange and I put it down to (and still believe it was) just a weird kind of feeling when one leaves school and their life changes forever and it's the beginning of being an adult which is a scary time for anyone. Over the year I'd go through different stages where for a few months I'd feel really positive and enjoy spending time with people and then for a few months I'd feel lonely and sad and not go out with friends for months on end. Then I went to university in September 2005 and felt very very sad. I think it was the shock of leaving home  living away from everyone I'd ever known and also the feeling of being back at school. I knew immediately that I'd made a terrible decision starting university  it wasn't what I wanted to be doing with my life and for the 6 weeks I was there I would stay in bed pretty much all day and not eat much. I think I lost about a stone and a half and even now  3 months after dropping out and moving back home I'm still half a stone lighter than I was last summer. So now I'm back at home and I've started a job cleaning tables in a cafe where I got on with the people I work with and I'm back in the same city as my girlfriend again and things should be ok but I keep dropping into really low moods.  A few weeks ago I thought that maybe it was depression and so I took some tests on the internet with what seem to be the basic questions. I tried to answer as truthfully as possible  you have to understand that depression is not something I want to have  I've known too many silly teenagers who think that having depression makes them interesting to other people and so they exaggerate emotions to try and look sad to find it appealing. So even though I found myself answering questions that I knew were making me seem depressed I answered the anyway because it was the truth. Things like a lowered libido  I find myself wanting to have sex with my girlfriend far far less frequently than I used to and to be honest a lot of the time when I'm having sex I feel that I'm just going through the motions. My sleeping which has always been a little odd has become increasingly erratic and I've found myself thinking about death a lot. To be honest though I thought that everyone thought about death and dying and that it was natural. I fin myself becoming very easily bored with people and situations and where I once used to enjoy writing stories I can't being myself to do it anymore. The worst thing though is the mood swings I have and the low moods I find myself in quite frequently. When I feel like this I don't want to be around anyone or have anyone talk to me and I can't stop myself thinking about bad things that have happened to me or could happen on a personal level and making myself the centre of blame for them. So am I depressed or is it just  as I'm leaning towards  a natural part of growing up and finding myself in the world of work and adulthood and trying to adjust to it. And if I am depressed how do I stop myself being this way? The thought of going to my doctor and sitting there and saying ""I think I'm depressed"" doesn't make much sense to me. I've always thought that with problems of that nature you must be told that you're ill and not decide for yourself that you are. Sorry if this has been very long and poorly punctuated  I wrote it all fairly stream of consciously. Any help at all would be very much appreciated  I'm feeling pretty vulnerable and down right now and don't want to feel this way anymore.",1
 Hi everyone. My name is Charlie and I have suffered from occasional bouts of depression for a while. Something that has recently taken my interest is the inferiority complex and how this affected my perceptions of things. I first got onto the idea through a page called Depression Hurts at a Hypnosis site 121 hypnosis (its worth plugging as I have found it useful). It took a while to admit to myself that I was afraid of not belonging  being criticized  sarcastic remarks at work etc and it stems back to horrid teachers and kids at school. This has been a turning point for me though - working through the false learnings and memories  so I thought I'd share it in case it resonates with anyone else. I've since recognized symptoms of inferiority in others (and they vary widely from conceited arrogance to total withdrawal)  and it's been really great.,1
 I have really been trying to 'control' my rage while driving. Since being medicated it's not as bad  but I can't stop. Today this guy chased me  forced me to pull over and started yelling  I thought he would hit me. I was surprisingly calm  not even afraid. I guess I just didn't care what happened to me at that point I hate when I get so angry  go into road rage mode  because I feel like crap afterwards  I don't like myself  I usually cry. I can't talk to my husband especially about this. I feel very isolated. All he does is get mad  lecture me  tell me to stop  don't you know it's dangerous  etc. He judges and blames me. He has no idea how I feel and I doubt he ever will. I feel better now that I can come here and talk to people who will understand my feelings (even if what I did is wrong  I hope???). It's very easy to say you'll change  you'll calm down. Easier said than done. I feel like I have to hide the fact that I'm in this forum from my husband  I have to hide a lot from him. I just hope that raving lunatic doesn't come after me if he finds out where I live. I have talked to my therapist about this but not in any depth  I only get 45 minutes of her time per session. I'd need hours. Thanks for listening  I feel a little better,1
 I'm a 23 yr old university student and I think I'm getting depressed again. One of the debates I'm having with myself is whether or not this is really depression. I was diagnosed with it about 2 years or so ago (although it wasn't my first bout of feeling low) and was put on a high dosage of medications (which I took). Things got better after a few months and so of course I stopped taking them cold turkey. Obviously not the best idea in the world  aside from this being one of the worst things to do because of the possibility of reoccurrence  my body went through heck and I had some pretty nasty side effects (even worse than when I was actually taking the meds). Fortunately  it didn't reoccur and I've been feeling fine until the past couple of months. I think I'm feeling the warning signs again: low energy  crying  circular thinking  apathy towards everything  skipping school  sleeping all day  anxiety ... I just feel like maybe this isn't really depression  maybe I'm just a person who doesn't handle stress well. Jeeze  when I read this it sounds so ridiculous. Part of me knows I'm being illogical but another part is just blaming me for being weak and not being able to just sit back and enjoy life. Why can't I just be happy? Why do I have to be so moody? Why am I so weak? It's stupid but I keep blaming myself. I don't think I'm bipolar since I've never experienced real highs but every couple of years or so my lows get really low. Last time was by far the worst and I wouldn't have been able to get through it without medications and I don't want it to get to that point again but ... I guess I still feel a lot of shame about it. It still feels like depression is being weak. I know  I know it's just like having diabetes and your body needs the chemicals to be normal but *sigh* I still blame myself. Last time I told my teachers and some friends and it's like they look at me as if I'm contagious or insane. I don't know if I can go through that again. But I don't know if I can keep on pretending everything is alright either ... ,1
 Well  I guess  i mean i know I need help. I lost my husband . he died of a heart attack at 56 on his walk home from a police station from being arrested for soliciting a prostitute.  two years ago  can't get over it. It was a bad scene  we were not great lovers or anything like that  more like companions  he cheated on me a lot and i just accepted it  but we did things together  ate out a lot  went to flea markets  he was nice to me  he loved me   he was just stupid  and i wouldn't have sex with him because of his indiscretion  I think he understood that.  After he died  about 6 months or so  I started going to a psychiatrist. He put me on lots of medications  it cost a lot of money  I was still depressed somewhat and really  I don't think he understood me at all. So about 6 months ago  I quit  everything  medications  therapy  etc.  I have a 30 year old son that lives with me and causes me a lot of grief  he has diabetes really bad and no job. Two days ago he was lethargic and his blood sugar was 500  I had to take him to the ER and I know it's going to cost me thousands of dollars. I have no extra money  but what does a person do. I tried to get him to get a job and it just turns into a yelling crying i am going to through you out of the house thing ... He is my child  I won't throw him out   .. oh  he also has adult ADD.  I have a real hard time socializing because i have low self esteem  I am fat  53 years old  not very attractive  and on and on. When I try to improve myself  I get frustrated  the weight   .... etc.  I think about suicide but that is stupid  I never act on anything like that. It's just a passing though time to time. I cry a lot  I am alone a lot.  All messed up huh. ,1
 I have just registered and thought I would introduce myself. I posted this in a different place but thought I would put it here too. I hope that is ok. I am Chris  female  age 50. I was diagnosed with depression 8 years ago following the sudden death of my best friend. I was doing ok and learning to live with it when my son  my only child  was killed by a drunk driver on Christmas Eve 2003. My world has collapsed. I was of work for 8 months but eventually returned there part time  and have been coping in my own way until the turn of the year when I had another breakdown. I am still off and isolating. I don't open the curtains; don't answer the door or the phone. Some days I can't see an end to it. To top that  my partner left around the same time because he said he couldn't live with my depression any more. I can't say I blame him. I wouldn't live with me either given the choice. I joined because it seems like a very supportive place  and I noticed you have a forum for grief which I think I could benefit from if allowed access. I sometimes think I'm going mad without my son  and no-one understands the way it is for me. Hopefully I will meet some of you soon. Take care all.,1
 I'm new here. But  I would like to know how to tell if I'm in depression. I have no idea where to post this at  but since I'm new here I guess this is the best place. Plus I can't start a new topic so... Well  anyway  here's how it is: Some days I can go without thinking about her  but at night  when I rest my head on my pillow  she eventually runs across my mind. When I say she  I mean my ex. More like.... I'm her ex. But eh... this took place a while back. Maybe like.... a year and a half. I met her 3 years ago in High-school. She was my very first true girlfriend and I didn't want anything to mess that up  but somehow I did that myself... or something along those lines. After a while of missing someone it doesn't really matter who was the blame for what. Sometimes when I make music I sing lyrics about her and how I want another chance and whatever. I'm not really obsessed with her or anything  but I sometimes want to just forget about her all at once  or wish I could go back 3 years. I guess that might be linked to regrets? Anyway  this whole thing is sort of an ON-OFF type thing  where sometimes I can't help but think about how it was  and sometimes  she's that last thing on my mind. Sort of like I put her on the back of my mind not to think about her  and save my hurt of later?? ... If that sounds right... Maybe I need a shrink. Who knows.... maybe i just need another girl.... But I'm pretty sure no other girl is going to want to listen to me talk about my past relationships. Anyway  feedback is appreciated,1
" I'm new to this forum and actually to the whole talking to people I don't know online thing.  I've been looking around a lot online to find somewhere I can talk  but all the chat rooms and forums say they're about one thing and then you get inside and everything's about sex.  Then I stumbled into this place.  I started reading postings and everyone seems so concerned about everyone even though they have never met these people.  I haven't struggled with depression my whole life or anything like that.  I am only 22 but feel so old.  I am very  very recently separated (let's face it broken up) with my ex-fiance.  We have dated for almost five years and have a son together who will be two on Saturday.  He hasn't treated me the best (never hit or anything physical like that just never around) and he's really not what I want my husband or even the father of my children to act like.  He does have moments of goodness and this is what makes it so hard because why can't he always act like that.  I know he's capable of it.  I told him we should separate but I know he's been thinking it for a long time.  He's been forcing things because of his family and because he feels ""respect"" and blah blah for me.  I stayed around because he's the father of my child and face it it's hard to find someone new when you're a woman and you already have a kid.  I love him very much and I guess I was just expecting him to wake up one day and say man I need to change or I'm going to lose this great girl.  I wanted to separate because I think that's the only way he's going to realize how good of a girl I am and how good I am for him.  Now I'm scared though that he'll never come to this realization or meet someone else.  He says he's not looking  but let's face it he's a man.  He says he needs at least 6 months to find himself.  It makes it hard on me because we have a son together and for this reason my ex is always coming around and actually now that we're not together we probably see him more.   I have no family where I live and the last 5 years have been devoted to my ex and son.  I have managed to lose contact with any friends I had and never made any new ones.  I am now completely alone except for my son  which I feel like I can't take good care of because I'm always crying.  I'm a high school teacher and I had to take a couple days off this week because I'm so touchy and can cry if the wrong thought pops up in my head.    It's affecting every part of my life and it's so overwhelming.  I used to be afraid that if we ever split I would end up alone with only one son and no family; now I'm afraid that he'll never come back!  I really just need someone to talk to. ",1
" I haven't been on this site for awhile because everything was going pretty good! Tonight it's all falling down though.  I don't even know what to say right now. I've just got to pound this keyboard. There's so much to say but I can't get it out correctly. Pretty pathetic when I can't even say anything but leave me alone. I sure wish there was someone to talk to. Someone to yell at  you know? Just to yell. Around my neighborhood it would be a sign of ""not all there""  you know? I finally see how a few of the people around here drive their cars off the cliff. It's almost spring  about another month to month and a half. If I can just wait that long  I can get out into the yard with the sun and feel better. I have to keep thinking of that  the sun and yard  something to look forward to.  My ""feel good"" days must have been pretty good because this downfall is pretty lousy. So lousy that I try to feel what I had been feeling  but it's almost like I can't remember it. Already!",1
 I am a 40 year old mother of two; ages 14 and 4. I guess I have been depressed about everything more recently  but have been really depressed for about 5 + years now. I thought bringing a new child into my life 4 years ago would help  but it only increased. I am so lonely  with no friends (well  one) since I moved to upper New York 4 1/2 years ago from Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania. I love my children  and my 21 hour job (that my doctor suggested). However  I do get to talk (chat) with anyone. I get every morning thinking that this day will be better  but it turns out to be sometimes worst than the day before ..... I guess  I am writing this to gain some friends  and feel that I am not alone in this situations I feel I am into .... I don't drink  I don't do drugs  and I take my prescribed Medications like I am suppose too ..... Is there anyone out there that would like to talk  or write  or e-mail me?,1
" I'm 46 and have been depressed since I was maybe 5 years old. I was emotionally abused by two confused parents. Depression & alcoholism runs rampantly in my family - fortunately I escaped the alcoholism. I was diagnosed as having major depression when I was about 25 and I've been on medication since then. I've also had intensive psychotherapy and done lots of research on the subject. Nothing erases the stigma!! ""Depression"" is misnamed. It should be called serotonin-deficiency disorder or something long and fancy so people will respect it. Too many say  ""Depression? Snap out of it!"" Or ""Do something to cheer yourself up."" What bunk. It affects every part of your body. Last year I realized that some of my depression was caused by kidney failure. I escaped dialysis and will probably be OK. But what a relief to have something ""serious"" to blame my problems on! Everybody respects kidney failure as a ""real disease"". I had to disown my brother last year because his reaction to my failing health was to call me a loser and an embarrassment. Very typical reaction from him  although the rest of my family were supportive. I now have no brother. I should have done it a long time ago. It takes such a long time to come to a point where you believe you deserve something good in life. I'm intelligent  employed and don't do drugs or alcohol  never have  but sometimes I feel like a bum  a worthless waste of space  not worth the effort. I have to argue myself out of that mindset every day  and it's so exhausting  and people wonder why I'm tired all the time and have no energy. I'm very angry  too. I have never had a successful relationship and don't believe I ever can. I don't even believe it exists. No kids  either  but maybe that's a good thing. They take a lot of emotional energy. Anyway  I hate to sound like a whiner  but sometimes you have got to whine!! And I'm happy to listen to everybody else and give them my support. We're all in the same boat here.",1
 you know how everyone hates those family get togethers  at least I do. All my family is out of state And I rarely get the chance to ever see mine  but that's off point  I have severe depression and a terrible panic disorder  at my last doctor appointment we were discussing easter coming up and how hard it is for me to go to my in laws  especially since no one there will ever talk to me (that's a whole other subject) anyway it was suggested to me that maybe we could invite the family over here for easter so that I would feel more secure. that way i could be busy with food and not feeling bad cause no one will speak to me. MY husband at the time when I spoke to him about it said that maybe it was a good idea  would be good for me. well today we had a bit of an argument over something i tried to do in here today  i just wanted him to try and understand what its like for me since he considers this a weakness not an illness  anyway  of course he went to his mothers  and accepted her offer for dinner and then came home and announced it to me  he didn't even bring up the possibility of maybe having it at our house. not even for me (also they have no idea about my illness   he is embarrassed i think) anyway  now I feel like he will never try to take my feelings into consideration.  I fell like throwing up I feel like shit I feel unloved ,1
 It's been happening for awhile .... i have been sexually harassed and sexually assaulted .... the kid next door who is the same age as me has been touching me in unwanted places ...... i tell him to stop and it gets worse .... it's not that i want to stop him it's that i can't stop him .... it has gotten worse he keeps touching me and now he would like me to have sex with him but i wont do it ...... he's going too far as it is .... if i keep telling him to stop .... then i don't what will happen next if i tell a cop then he just as well kill me cause i don't know what his reaction will be and i don't think i want to go there to find out.....i have no one i want to tell so i really can't spill unless I'm on here cause no one knows who i really am and what kind of person i am ..... I'm scared ...... i have been violated ... what's next .... well i guess I'll find out tomorrow,1
 I have a gripe about pharmaceutical and insurance companies.  You can take up to 450 mg / day of Wellbutrin XL.  The manufacturer makes 150 mg and 300 mg pills  but not a 450 mg pill.  OK  so just take 3 of the 150's  right?  Well if the doctor prescribes it that way  at least one insurance company won't pay for it.  The doctor has to prescribe it as one 300 mg pill plus one 150 mg pill - thereby making the patient have to pay 2 co - payments for what should be one prescription.   Why doesn't the manufacturer make a 450 mg pill?  And how can the insurance companies get away with forcing doctors to prescribe in what is really a stupid manner?  I know it all comes down to money  but  of course  we patients get the short end of the stick as usual when it comes to the money issue. ,1
  First I want to introduce myself  I live in Arkansas I am 39 and a mom to 4 (18  15  8 and 3) I have been on and off different antidepressants for almost 4 years. Started out with celexa after I had my last baby  went through some ppd and haven't been the same since. I was on celexa for 14 months then stopped for 7 months  then went back on it and totally had a bad reaction. Then came zoloft  that lasted about 3 months sent me in to some sort of mania  then there was wellbutrin  wanted to drive off the road in to the lake on that  then came effexor which I thought worked but apparently I also was going through rapid cycling  I kind of liked that. I spent 3 months on that and about a month on the wellbutrin. Then came paxil cr  was on that for 6 months but I just cant get past these mood swings and outbursts. So now I have been on Lexapro for almost 3 months  today the doctor decided to increase me to 20 mg and add lamictal for my mood swings. I am a little nervous about starting this new one. This rash I hear about sounds scary. I also take 1 mg of klonopin as needed(everyday) I just wonder if I will ever feel the same again  but then it has been so long that I don't know if I would even know what that feels like. Sorry to ramble on  but that's my story. I am to start the lamictal tonight. wish me luck!! If anyone has any input for me I would really appreciate it ,1
 i feel like i keep sinking lower and lower into this depression  and i can't get out from under it.  i keep feeling worse  day by day  i am drifting downwards further into the darkness.  maybe i'm just having a tougher time of it lately  maybe i really am getting sicker  i don't know.  all i do know is how i feel  and i feel like giving up.  i don't want to do anything anymore  i have no desire to do or want a single thing.  i can't live like this.  i just want out  to stop feeling so lethargic and so severely depressed.  It's getting to me a lot more i guess  but i just don't want to be like this anymore.  It's taking me over and swallowing me whole  and i feel like letting it win.,1
 When I was twelve  one of my younger sisters got leukemia. Despite my failing memory I can still remember a lot of what happened back then. I can remember being picked up at the park where I was playing to rush to the hospital where my sister had been getting tested. You could say I was whisked away from my innocence  but you're pretentious and I'm not. I can remember how my mother broke the news to me. And how her voice cracked a little when I asked how bad she had it. I can remember sitting in the front room of my grandparent's place  where I was staying so my parents could be with my sister in hospital  speaking to my cousin and saying that I felt it was somehow my fault. What followed was roughly a year of total disruption. My sister became the focus  understandably  while the rest of us learned to cope with the cloud hanging over us. Where a small rise in temperature could send hearts racing. But that has mostly been forgotten. Not blocked away  just forgotten. It was another age and doesn't feel real anymore. In the past few months the hospital has been doing a study of ex-patients and their families. Tonight it was my turn to do the phone interview. I'd been avoiding it  mostly because I'm lazy and I only ever seem to do things that I feel will be enjoyable to me. Anyway  so they called through and I spoke. I don't think there were really any surprises  although it was bizarre when I became conscious to the fact that I occurred to her getting cancer as it or that. I think I only said cancer once in the entire interview. Does that mean I'm crazy? Struggling to cope? I don't know. Of the questions they asked  I don't think I answered any that would cause a worry.,1
 Now this stupid posting thing is screwed up - I can't do anything right      Got the old depressed suicide bug again.      It's funny because last night i read some articles I had written  regarding death and suicide  many about saving other depressed persons from killing themselves  recognizing the pain that the survivors go through  and not wanting it to happen to my family. And then the thought rears its ugly head  it would be so easy to let myself go  go into that peaceful night  waiting until my mom dies first (soon - natural causes) and then doing it. Because I am a failure  I can't do anything else but fail at my job. I used to write in a cave type place - a place where my writings would be secure and it's going away. That's how come I looked at my writings.      I had told my therapist that it seems sometimes I feel angry and selfish and that's one of the triggers that trigger the thoughts of suicide. I have run out of visits covered by insurance I could pay for more but there is no need for visits - I've almost stopped talking. I feel like going home  crawling up on my bed with the teddy bear my husband hates and crying. At the cave web site  the others don't like to hear about suicide so I've stopped writing there (it's another site for depression type people - no one goes there now). I keep talking about death and suicide to my husband and my kid - and I feel guilty but the words and my thoughts are obsessed with death. I can make the decisions about my mom and my kid  but this halfway limbo concerning my states sucks.       I guess this is just venting. My mom has at least another week to live .... ,1
 Things seem to follow you everywhere  things such as thinking of suicide and almost doing it. I did these things a few years ago well in a term of service with the US Army and was put in a ward for a few weeks and then released without even a proper name for what ever I was suffering from  and was sent to Iraq a week after leaving the ward. That as I said was a few years ago and I really never wound up in a hospital again yet  after I returned home and since it seems everyone knew I had one little problem. A problem that seems to plague me even to this day for I am now in the reserves and was yet sent to go back to Iraq but I was sent home due to on going mental problems from a few years ago. What I really want to know is there something really wrong with me or is this just a huge joke. I have been to doctors more then once and just with really nothing to go on but a shaken head. so I just was hoping someone out there knows or been though this really  as for my feelings inside it is hard for me to express I do not like to talk much of what goes on up stairs do to at times I don't really understand why at times I either feel like hurting someone or just having that lump in my throat feeling like I am going to cry but I cannot. Anyway answers please and this is my first ever post here I due hope you can read my rambling.,1
 Hi everyone  I'm new  and feeling kind of lost and shy. To introduce myself a little  I'm a 28 year old female. Up until about a year ago  I'd never had any problem with depression or any other mental illness  though all of the other women in my family have depressive tendencies. Suddenly  I started to feel differently in my mind - a feeling which has gone on getting worse and worse. The last four months in particular have been a downward spiral. I moved house from a big city to a small village late last year  and I'm not dealing with the change well. I don't know anyone in my local area  and I don't drive so I'm stuck in this little isolated world (I work from home). I lack the energy and the confidence to go out and meet new people. I tend to organize/run everything in our household so basic routines have just fallen apart  and my long-term relationship is under strain. My partner doesn't understand how I feel  while I resent the fact that he's making no effort to recognize the problem and take some action to help. My family and friends are 300 miles away  and I don't feel able to talk to them. This last week  I found out my Mum is having tests run for breast cancer. I know it's early days but it's just the last little thing that has pushed me over the edge. I am walking around either in a state of complete  grey numbness or in a state of unutterable misery  unable to react to anything in a rational way. I haven't left the house for days  because I hate the village where I live and being there just sends me into a blind panic attack. I've had an initial assessment for counseling in a city near where I live  but it'll be weeks before I can get an appointment. I know that I need to go and see a GP and get some medication  but I don't have the energy even to pick up the phone and talk to the receptionist  let alone to walk on my own through the horrible village. And I'm just so exhausted all the time. The internet's my only point of contact with the outside world at the moment. If all this sounds familiar to anyone  please reply - it would be a lifeline for me. Thanks Wizzy.,1
" Hi - I am ""dad"" a new member today (12/18/05) I like what I have seen so far and have a need to express myself and get some feedback from others. It is so hard to look at yourself..... especially when wearing the ""dark glasses"" of depression. I am a man in my late 40's - educated  with family- wife and two great  smart  loving kids  15  and 13. I will try to summarize my story. About 5 yrs ago  I was laid off (tech field)...it was very hard to find another good position. We were so spoiled  I was making 70K - 100K in the past few years. We took it for granted. We built (4) new houses since 1989 - and did well. We enrolled our kids in a private Christian school (a high priority for us) THEN - My wife was in a auto accident and has spinal damage. She is ""mobile""  but has chronic pain. She is also suffering from depression. I managed to find another job  but it was a very dysfunctional place. I had to take a few leave-of absences - then I became ""pegged"" as a weak person. They eventually let me go for ""too many LOA's"" I'm paying $800 for COBRA - we can't do this forever....the pressure just adds to my anxiety. After seeing my psychiatrist  he took me through MANY medicines and even ECT's.... we tried for three years to find the most effective drug. Presently I take Zoloft  Cymbalta  Lamictal Xanax & Valium for anxiety. I also have osteopenia (bone density loss)  so I take  fosamax and Tylenol 4 (narcotic) for back/joint pain. Lastly  I use Soma for muscle strain. I don't know if the medicines are helping me or adding to the problem....? I admit I ""lean on"" some of the medicines as a coping mechanism. I have had so many situational events in the last few years  I suspect my depression is more environmentally caused...? I seem to ruminate on the ""bad events of the past"" too much. I am ""stuck"" - and just can't seem to get aggressive at my job hunt. We just sold our 6 bedroom house and are now living in a three bedroom apartment. I feel guilty that my family has to go through this. I know that I have skills and experience; but I don't have the self confidence - my ego is ""on the floor"". My sleep pattern is crazy and my appetite for food (and sex) is GONE. My wife is getting frustrated with me and doesn't always ""build me up""... Her depression has her down too.... With two depressed parents it is very difficult to support each other. I feel ""stuck"" and don't know what to do....sometimes I just feel like giving up.... Any comments or thoughts would be appreciated!",1
 Hello everyone. I'm here because I'm starting to have doubts about my mental health... First off I'm a 21 year old male college student  and up until about 2 years ago I think I've been fine...but lately I'm not so sure. For one thing I can't seem to concentrate or focus on ANYTHING anymore and it's becoming very frustrating. I find myself daydreaming or pacing only minutes after I sat down to do something important and because of it I can't get anything done. I can't even focus on things that should be fun  or the things I used to be dedicated too. I've also become very philosophical. I always find myself spending a lot of time thinking about life and death  the nature of existence  etc...But it seems like its becoming an obsession. I always feel like I'm wasting time but I can't bring myself to do anything constructive. Sometimes I'm disgusted when I realize how much time I spend simply pacing back and forth. I also can't fall asleep at night anymore...I just lie awake thinking and I can't make it stop. I also have constant fears about becoming old and having regrets about how I lived and what I accomplished. I also have constant regrets about the past. It seems like there's nothing I can do in life to satisfy myself and it driving me crazy...especially because for all the ambition I have I have no motivation whatsoever anymore. Also it's hard to explain  but I get the feeling that I can't feel life  if that makes any sense? It's like time is moving so fast that I can't even realize it.  Anyway  I was never like this before and I have no reason to be like this now. I don't have relationship problems or family problems and I'm not religious. This all just came out of nowhere with no apparent cause. Basically it has come to the point where I know something is wrong with me but I don't know what. I've kept telling myself this is nothing but its getting more intense and now I feel like I'm spiraling into a void or something. I guess I'm simply here to seek some opinions on what my problem could be. Thanks a lot for taking the time. PS I may have posted this in the wrong place but its my first post so I'm not sure...,1
 I am 43 years old and I still feel that I'm dealing with my parents' terrible marriage.  I feel like I don't know anyone else who is in this situation.  I have teenage children and have found that I can't just move away because they are so embedded in their school and friends  but sometimes  just once and for all  I want to live away from my folks. Their marriage has always been terribly dysfunctional and now it is much worse as they are older. When I was young  it was awful  but I still felt like there was some love there. Now  I fell like I witness nothing but hatred between them.  I have confronted them many times - but  there is a strong sense of manipulation whenever this happens and I am left feeling that it is somehow my fault that I don't want to be around miserable people - Any suggestions? How can I finally live my own life?  I'm really depressed tonight. I feel like I can't continue living like this. I am a grown women and I'm still living around and letting my parents' miserable marriage effect me.,1
 Glad I can help! Firelizardee has helped me a lot over on the effexor room (that's where most of my posts are). I've never really posted my story  but for what it's worth  here it is: I live in northern New York State where I grew up on the family farm. My brother and I run a feed/hardware/farm supply store. I've got a terrific wife and two daughters ages 1 and 3. My depression hit in January during a bout with the flu; my youngest daughter was hospitalized with febrile seizures and that might be what put me over the edge. My nervous breakdown seemed to come out of the blue  but I'd had an extremely stressful six months between job  illness  and adoption.  I'm also a hard driving firstborn perfectionist  and several family members have had alcoholism or suspected depression. So I guess depression should not have been so big a surprise  but it was. I'm a happy person with a great life! But I feel like I've been right to the edge of the precipice and looked down at Hell. Now I'm doing everything I can to ensure I don't relapse.....but I actually think I'm a better person having been through this. I'm much more appreciative of a 'good day' and I'm much more attuned to the suffering of others. It's amazing how many people I know have similar problems. And I hate that it has to be this way  but suffering does bring me closer to God. I hardly dare say that depression and anxiety was 'worth it'....the memory of the anguish is still too vivid  and besides  it could come back tomorrow. But right now  today  I feel more contented with my crazy  precious  stupid  dear  wasted  amazing life than I have been in years. I'm very lucky to have stumbled onto the right medication the first time  and to have a supportive family that didn't tell me to 'snap out of it'. And I'm very lucky to have the people here in this forum  who know what it's like. I hope  tvk  that in a few weeks you too will be a recovering depression survivor. Till then  we're here when you need us!,1
 Hi everyone I'm pleased to have found this place  maybe I will find some people here who understand what it is like to be struggling with depression. I am currently locked in my own personal hell caused by years of problems that I would never wish on anyone. I have tried to cope on my own for about 15 years (I'm 28)  everything has started to go well in my own life and now is the time that it has found a way out (or that's what my psychiatrist has told me). I was married on my birthday in 2005 (I keep calling it this year because I keep forgetting that were now in 2006) and my husband tries to understand but how can he really? I'm off work at the moment because it's too much for me to cope with. I've recently been forced into getting help and I'm waiting for counseling at the moment (there's a 10 week waiting list). I've also been on 10mg cipralex for the last 18 months. I think that's enough to be going on with for now  and its got to be the most somber intro I've ever written! I do look forward to chatting to you all Deb x,1
 So here is my situation .. I want to go to University .. Problems: I don't have a cent to my name  parents will not give their ok on the issue and I haven't had a job in over a year and there are no prospects in the near future. I could go behind their backs and apply for a loan but I would just feel a lot better knowing they were ok with it all  I don't want money from them. Some meaningless minimum wage job is not going to make me feel good  if anything it will make me feel worse about myself. I have not accomplished a single thing in my life and feel this is pretty much the last straw to do something meaningful  but day after day there is another block and I have no means of getting around it  I'm 100% dependant on my parents (who are usually the blocks) and I hate it. This isn't something I want  its something I need..,1
 I have never chatted on a chat line before. So please bear with me. I'm 29 years old married with three children. In the last 12 months I have lost my grandmother in September 2004  my father in February 2005  gave birth to a baby girl in May 2005  and now lost my only aunt which was just like a mother to me.  The way I feel now scares me.  I thought after I lost my grandma and dad I held it together pretty good  but after my aunt died I felt like I lost everything.  I have always been a very strong person someone other people leaned on. Now I literally can't get out of bed  I don't want to talk to anyone  or see anyone.  My mind feels like it is racing with things i have to do like cook  clean  pay bills  tend to my children  but i just can't do anything.  I even quit my job because i simply felt i couldn't go to work.  I would just like to know what is happening.   ,1
 This is a great topic. It looks like people associate with what was shared. I was laughing a little because for awhile I was so hypersensitive to sound I would not even consider turning anything on that created noise  even the noise from lights was too much. I used to go to a counselor who had a radio on in her waiting room. I could not stand it and used to turn it off. Then someone would turn it back on  having no understanding of what it was like to be me at that moment. That's funny to me now. I still don't like noise but I'm lucky since I have pretty good control over my environment. For awhile I was working in cubicles and was not sure I was going to make it. The one comment I wanted to share was what I experienced when I did turn the TV back on  read the newspaper  listened to the radio. I went without it for two years. What I experienced was the way the news was presented. I was captivated not by the words or circumstances of stories  but the tone of voice  the selection of what sound bites to use  the background chosen for a shot. I'm still fascinated by all that and even dreamed the other night I had been hired to be that person who decides how to present something. In my dream I was having a moral dilemma. My integrity is important to me and  in my dream  I was talking to my boss and trying to explain the emotional angst I was in. She kept saying  give them what they want  who are you to decide what is best for them. I woke up before I decided to quit or stay. But those words stayed with me through a day  who am I to decide what's best for someone else? What I do now is selectively listen to the news. I like NPR and sometimes enjoy McNeil Lehrer. I find if someone is expressing a strong opinion I will get annoyed if the presentation does not also include an opposing viewpoint. My main issue is selective presentation. I feel disrespected if someone is asking me to just trust them. I want to know what are the observations leading to a conclusion. I want to know what level of uncertainty there is. I don't like anyone telling me how to think or feel. I'm perfectly capable of creating all the drama I could ever use  on my own. I'm not clear where to place blame for all the drama the industry of information puts out there. I know someone is to blame. If only I could find that person or group then my hatred would be perfect. I'm kidding about that last sentence. I'm just trying to get a rise out of someone reading my share--I'm being frisky. I support public broadcasting and free speech. If I was in charge meetings would last forever because everyone would get a chance to speak. Wouldn't it be great if there truly was free speech in America. Wouldn't it be great if the principle of dissent was truly an American ideal. Isn't it supposed to be?,1
 Hi everyone  I am a 39 year old complete mess up. I have suffered from depression most of my life. About 18 years ago my world crashed around my head. I went into blackness like no other. Attempted suicide several time  went through a period of self mutilation  went on every depression drug known to mankind  through years of therapy. This lasted 10 years. I took a massive overdose and was on life support for 5 days. When I finally regained consciousness my doctor told me it was a miracle I was alive. After that I seemed to put my life back on track. I still suffered periods of depression but nothing extreme. Until now that is. Now I feel myself slipping into that hole again and I am terrified.,1
 I'm from MD and I too am going through a depression / anxiety moment in my life. I am just always feeling unappreciated like no one really cares about me as a person  unless they need something from me  I am currently overweight  I feel ugly  I have absolutely no motivation in life whatsoever to want to do ANYTHING. If I could sleep all the time I would. My Mother  whom is or was my best friend  never calls me unless she need money  clothes  etc. My Sister  she never calls unless she need a ride somewhere  my kids are the same way  my Husband on the other hand does not make any moves to want to make love together when we go to bed  years ago he would used to then he stopped because I never did  but we moved past that dumb shit or so I thought  now when I try he will  but he never does anymore  I am not going to make that move all the time  it's all just a game and I can't play it anymore. It's childish and I just don't need that on top of everything else I'm dealing with. I have a problem with dealing with people  like trying to have a conversation with someone sometimes is hard for me  I feel nervous and get all tongue tied when I'm talking to people  it don't happen with everyone I deal with  just some. I have friends  but they never call me  I have to call them  and it's like they ALL do this  is it me? Is it something I'm doing wrong? I just don't know anymore. I feel like I want to take something sometimes  I feel like I want to run away sometimes  I don't feel suicidal at all  so I guess there's hope. Well that's pretty much all about me. I hope to maybe make some new friends on here.,1
 My bottom line concern is that I'm suddenly afraid of men. When a man speaks to me in public I'm suspicious of his intentions  and when a man was openly flirting with me two days ago I left the store and then became afraid that he might follow me home and had to go sleep with my 4 year old in his room with the door locked that night. I'm even nervous and suspicious of men I've known  like spouses of friends. Background. My husband is in the military and has been deployed. He's been gone since September and since the beginning I've had a fear of being in the house alone at night and it has progressed to this. I'm a fairly sane person for the most part. I dealt with some PPD when our son was born and my OBGYN gave me Xanax which was NO GOOD. My PCP put me on Lexapro which worked out just fine and I weaned off of it about a year and a half ago. I know this behavior is abnormal  but I can't seem to stop it. Can I have a little push in the right direction?? ,1
" Where to start.... Well  I guess I'm here because I think I have depression. I did recently talk to a therapist about it a couple of weeks ago. I guess it did some good because I feel like I may have gotten to the root of my problems. She told me that I was depressed and that I have probably had a low grade depression for most of my life. I kind of thought that I was depressed  because when I would read an article about depression with 10 yes or no questions I would usually answer yes to nine of them. The original reason my wife and I went to a counselor in the first place was because my wife was mad about my occasional habit of looking at pornography on the internet. I understand this bothers her and I do not want to do anything that will upset her. I could never give her an acceptable reason why I did it. I really do not know why myself. I do not think that I have an addiction to sex. It does not dominate my thoughts or life by any stretch of the imagination. In fact  I think that I am pretty ""tame"" compared to most males. Anyway  this causes a lot of strife in my marriage because my wife considers this cheating on her. Well  back to depression. We got to talking about this in counseling and the counselor asked me if I'd ever been molested before. Oh boy. Well  this has always been the big secret part of my life. When I was 6 or 7 years  a female cousin of mine  who was about 4 years older  played some ""touching"" games with me over the course of 2 summers. It was all just touching  but I knew it was wrong. She would tell me that I could never tell anyone because I would get in trouble. So I didn't  until that therapy session. No  I had never told my wife because I always felt embarrassed and like I was to blame because I did not do anything to stop my cousin. I pretty much told the therapist (and my wife of course)  everything that had happened to me. I got REALLY upset and probably cried more than anytime in my adult life. I felt somewhat better after talking  but inside I still feel ashamed and responsible for it. The counselor said that because of those incidences  I have had a low grade depression all these years because of holding it all in. I have ALWAYS had a hard time expressing my feelings about anything to anyone. That's just me. I told the therapist that I could see the low grade depression in my day to day life  but there are times when I feel like there is a huge  massive black cloud on me. I can be doing just about anything when suddenly I have this overwhelming feeling of dread and emptiness. There are times that I feel like if I could wish for my own death at that instant  I would gladly do it. When I don't have those bad lows  I just feel numb. The therapist said I might want to try medication  but I already take two different things for chronic physical conditions  and I really do not want to take anymore drugs. I don't like doing anything that I used to do; reading  sports  movies  etc. I have a teenaged son who is just terrific. He is extremely intelligent and just a great kid. I do not want my ""condition"" affecting him anymore than it already has. My wife is sometimes supportive  but I think she is tired of my moods. I have not had the porn problems any longer and I feel like I have gotten past that. (The therapist attributed those times of porn weakness to depression and looking for a way out). I feel like since the counseling sessions that the low grade depression has gotten worse. I am glad that I talked about the things that happened and how I've felt  but I really do feel worse than before. Is there anything I can do besides more drugs? I just don't think those are the answer. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.",1
 I'm new to the forum and just wanted to say Hi to everyone My depression stems from my husband and his secretive actions and cheating. I love my husband we have been together for 16 years and have 2 children together. He went to Thailand with his dad last year to visit his brother who lives over there working as a teacher  but before he left he found this website forum owned by a bar owner there who uses bar girl prostitutes as waitresses. To make this long story short he went with one of these bar girls while he was there and it took my children to find out the truth because I was too stupid to find out myself lol One found pictures of her in his organizer and the other found text messages on his cell phone. I should have known something was up as he never leaves his cell phone on anymore when at home anymore since he came back. He sits on that forum when at work and also at home all the men on that forum talk about the bargirls and post pictures of them also. My daughter sent a text message to the woman and she said a lot of hurtful things to her  I was worried for a few days that my husband would find out she was contacted and blame me. We also found pills he has been taking that he got from India called tadalasil which is a form of viagra  as far as I know he never had a problem sexually so why is he taking these pills? who knows lol My cousin called me a couple of days ago and said he posted a message on that forum saying he wants to go back to thailand again and what excuse could he give me for wanting to go  she said he also said that he posted he doesn't want to cheat on me just fuck other women when I'm not around. She checks the forum for me as I don't want to see it but it hurts just as bad when someone tells you what he puts. He doesn't have any friends really here where we are because all he does is works so I don't know if the men on the forum are substitutes for real friends and he is putting what they would find interesting or what. I don't drive and we live out in a rural area with no real neighbors so I don't get into town barely and I don't have many real friends here as we moved here to do some job work. So that saying LIFE SUCKS really seems to fit lately lol My concern lately is sex transferred diseases such as AIDS as I found out that thailand is known as a sex trade country and many have the disease. Prostitution is illegal there but they allow businesses to operate like that bar due to the money the male tourists bring there. The government is going to give asia and africa millions of dollars to help research AIDS but they are not going to make Thailand help stop the spread of the disease by shutting down places that promote prostitution  they worry about bird flu or about people carrying weapons onto planes but they don't care if men bring a silent killer like AIDS back into our country and infect their spouses or lovers. Do I sound crazy? because sometimes I feel I am going crazy lol I'm sorry for rambling on but I have held this in for months  scared to talk to him as i love him with all my heart even if others say I'm an idiot and scared to talk family and friends anymore about it because it hurts to much. ,1
 Ok here goes. I actually feel like I don't deserve to be looking at this site. I've been sitting here all morning reading through everyone's posts and have been think that I have no right to hate my life. I have a good family  friends and have had experiences other 20yr olds would only dream of. But there is something in my head telling me that my life sucks and nobody cares if I am here or not. Then the real me kicks back in and I think I am stupid for thinking that. STUPID. Stupid for thinking I have no purpose. So that makes me feel even worse. I fear. I don't know. Being alone and rejected I guess. I don't do I often but when I am having a 'fat week' I have purged and over exercised. I don't know if this is because I really think I am fat or. I don't know why else  but I am not overweight. I have never told any one any of this in person. I can't do it. I hate sympathy. When I am around my friends I am totally the opposite. I am so hyper and half the time it is not even an act sometimes I just can't control. Other times I do have to put it on just so that don't ask me if anything's up but I have never failed to fool them. Anyway that's enough,1
 Hi all  I've just registered here... I've been depressed for quite a while  my dad died when I was 7 and my best friend died when we were 18. After the death of my father I was in counseling  but my counselor stopped coming to school to see me and I don't think I ever got anywhere from it. I'm currently 23  almost 24 (and male  from the UK for those keeping count) I've felt crap for ages... I hate my job  and doing that along with the stress of my final year of university sent me on a downward spiral. I would worry so much about my workload  but have no motivation to do it and get out of the situation. I hate being single  but can't find someone special who likes me  who I like back. I want to leave my job  but I can't afford to until I leave university and get a job doing something I want to. I had thought about suicide  but I know the pain of losing people close to me  and I couldn't inflict that pain on someone else. I considered cutting myself too. I thought that maybe if I was hurt  I could get extra time for university work  and maybe someone would help me. But I realized that I shouldn't do that  and should see someone about it. I also didn't have the balls to do it. I think bad thoughts a lot but I don't think I could go through with them. I was worried about going to the doctor though. My previous experience with a counselor has put me off them  and I don't like talking to strangers about my problems - that said I don't like telling people I know either because I feel that they will judge me. I was also concerned about medication because I don't know if I like the idea of chemicals altering my brain (apart from alcohol that is!) But about 3 weeks ago I finally went to see my doctor. He has put me on 20mg of Fluoxetine a day  although I'm not sure whether it is doing much. I've been having headaches and going a bit dizzy as well as getting sleepy (among other side effects). It's weird though  I don't know whether I'm feeling better or not  my friends say I seem different and better for taking it but I still feel bad at times... I still lie in bed at night worrying. But I think maybe I need to take it more and see how it effects me long term. I guess even on medication we all have good days and bad days. I was scared to tell my mother that I was on anti-depressants  as she works in mental health. Some would see this as a blessing as she understands the field to a great degree  but I was worried because I thought that she might think I was mad. I eventually got the courage to tell her after about 5 days though because I was very dizzy and I thought that she would suspect me of being on illegal drugs. She is being very supportive now  while still keeping enough distance that I don't feel like she's worrying too much about me. It's good to know that she understands that it's going to help me cope though... and she says its only a minor drug compared to what some of her patients take to stop the voices telling them to do things. Anyway I decided to look for somewhere online where other people know what it feels like  and I am glad that I've found this place. I hope I can make some new friends here  and maybe I can help a couple of people too.,1
" The last few weeks I have slid back almost as far as before I started treatment. Just when I thought I was improving.  I finally went to the drop in center called Sunshine Place  as someone was giving a talk on depression. The counselor spoke with me for about half an hour after her talk and said she thought I needed more help than my GP was giving. For the first time in a few months I actually broke down and cried again - which is very annoying to me. She wrote down the number of the Mental Health Center with some suggestions for them. I rang the next day for an appointment (and that was hard just to ring). She had told me I might have to wait a few weeks for them to see me  but they made an appointment for the next day.  The psychiatirst there was okay (I didn't even cry like I normally do when talking to a new doc) but I told her I was tired of telling the same things to every new person. The short of it is they are changing me from Lexapro to Avanza and organizing for some CBT. I see my regular GP next Tuesday so I am pleased they said they would inform her of the medication change. I was also warned that I would probably feel a bit more depressed while the medication change was taking place; so I duly warned Mom and Matt not to take any notice of any strange behavior. Matt as usual just laughed and said ""yeah  Mom's going to go psycho"".  Now I just wait for them to contact me about the CBT.  If I don't answer any posts you'll know why  but I will try to just put a little emoticon up every now and then to let you know I am thinking of you all  and that I am still listening. ",1
" Ice 'n' snow 'n' sleet...damn! We had to stay an extra night in B-ham because of the icy roads between here and there. I had an obscenely fun time  and it reaffirmed that I am a complete sucker for 4-part harmonies. The Tallassee Gold Edition male show choir was freaking fantastic--they sang ""Carry On  Wayward Son""  ""Gaston"" from Beauty and the Beast  ""One More Day"" from Les Mis (heartx10 000 000)  and ""It's Hip to Be Square"" *dies over and over*. Our female show choir swept the awards in the women's division  it was awesome XD A unanimous  high-pitched clamor that is probably still reverberating through the atmosphere in Africa or something... The co-ed show choir got first runner-up in their division  plus best costumes and best choreography. Yet  the choir that beat us won no caption awards...*grumbles something about blind and deaf show choir bureaucrats* Oh  and the Enterprise show choir sang ""Letters From War"". I CRIED LIKE A BABY. I always do when I hear that song. And apparently I'm hysterical at midnight. At least  according to Katherine and Quinn  two saxophonists I was rooming with. Please let school be cancelled tomorrow. Oh please please please.",1
" In college (10 years ago) I was the victim of a gang rape. I've read up quite a bit and identified with all the stages and normal reactions... I went through the self blame  and guilt  and anger  and depression  and I came to realize it wasn't my fault. I never reported it and after a year I decided the best thing would be to forget about it. I pretended it didn't happen and went on with my life. I forced it out of my thoughts until it was no longer a struggle to do so. Eventually I almost did forget about it. I never thought about it and when the subject was referenced in other contexts I never even thought about my particular experience. It almost became some movie I saw  or some girl I knew about. I'm married now with a four year old child and I have a really great life. About six months ago I started having these rape fantasies. I've been too embarrassed to ask my husband to act them out  but he does oblige in rough sex  and I started asking for it more often. I've felt confused as to why I would want this with my husband (and it is always with him ... I don't desire this with anyone else) when I have this history. It started me thinking about them even again. Then I started having nightmares about three weeks ago. Horrible realistic dreams where I actually wake up and I'm still hallucinating that men are holding me down. Last night I punched my husband full in the chest because I thought he was attacking me when he was just trying to wake me from a nightmare. This along with the COMPLETE lack of sexual desire where before we had a very healthy sex life. I'm a big fan of the ""STOP THAT"" approach to self help  but I can't seem to stop this. I'm beginning to dwell on it now. Also I try not to ever deny husband and with the high job related stress he's having right now he's seeking sexual gratification every night. I'm beginning to dread bed time  and after he's asleep I'm up on the computer and drinking! ",1
" I've been reading the ""hoarding"" thread in the OCD forum and I'm jealous. They're having fun bonding by sharing stories about their habits  so I thought we could do some of that with plain old depressives. Sometimes when I'm depressed  I realize that I'm crying over something so stupid that I have to step back and laugh at how upset I've gotten over dumb things. I can't remember all of them  but here are some of the ""highlights"" on the list of Silly Things That Made Starry kitten Cry: my boyfriend told me his cat was giving me a ""mean look"" I set out a pack of Marshmallow Peeps to get nice and crispy in the open air and my roommate threw them out. (Oh  there were tears!). The coffeehouse was out of soymilk on a day I really wanted some soy hot chocolate. What's on your list?",1
 I'm a 24 year old woman living in Florida with my husband. I have been severely depressed for 6 months  and now looking back I can see that it actually started about a year and a half ago. If only I could go back and warn myself.  Like many of you  I have been suffering depression since I was very young. In fact  I can remember being in first grade  coming home and going to bed for the rest of the night. Of course  back then it felt more like fear. In 7th grade  I asked my mother if I was a manic depressive because I had read about it and I felt I had all the symptoms. She scoffed and said it was just normal teen hormones that made me feel that way.  I love my mother and she has always been there for me. I used to call her at 2 in the morning crying and she would talk to me until I felt better. However  when I call her up today  she still doesn't understand when I tell her I am depressed. She thinks I need to get up and start doing things until I snap out of it. I try to tell her I have bills screaming at me and I still can't get out of the house to find work. I think she is in denial. Now  with all of the information I find on this site  I think I may even be bipolar.  When I found the man I wanted to marry  I warned him that I had experienced many deep depressions in my lifetime and that it was probably likely to happen again someday. He said he would stay by my side no matter what  and he has. Unfortunately  it is painfully apparent that he has no idea at all how to handle it. When he tries to talk to me and cheer me up  I say mean things to him until we are both raising our voices. Let me tell you  when I'm like this  I don't back down either. I usually say something hurtful and then grind my teeth in anger for a while. He gets mad too  but it is also painfully apparent that he forgives me. Then  I feel like a real jerk.  I just started seeing a psychologist  since I haven't had a job since last August and it's clear that I don't know my way out of this. I have only met with her once  but I think I will like her. She has told me to do a few simple things everyday until our next meeting on Wednesday. She wants me to get 1/2 hour of sunlight everyday  15 minutes of exercise  and try to make a simple daily schedule to follow. I'm a bit worried because I haven't been able to do them because I just don't sleep right anymore. It is 8am and I haven't slept yet. I may fall asleep in a few hours  only to toss and turn and then wake up in the evening feeling like crap. I have tried some medicines but they don't help. Have any of you had this problem? What did you do? ,1
 I'm not sure where to start.  I've been diagnosed with PTSD  depression  disassociation  and bipolar.  I'm also a cutter  suicidal  I hear things and see things.  Needless to say I don't deal with stress very well.   Sorry this isn't a good introduction; but I really do need some help.  I'm a college student only because the VA (veterans Affairs) is paying for it through their vocational - rehabilitation program.  I'm unemployed.  For 3 months I've been fighting with social services just to get food stamps.  I finally got them.  Beforehand food was scarce.  I've had eviction notices and by miracles my roommate and I manage to get just enough money to not get evicted at the last minute.  I've missed class and 2 therapy and other doctor appointments because I haven't had the gas money to get there.  I apply for jobs every day  but I have absolutely no luck getting a job.  So with all this any normal person would become naturally depressed.  But me  I'm losing my mind.  I can be happy and laughing and goofing off with my boyfriend one minute; but the next I'm kicking and hitting and seriously hurting him.  Then we end up in some stupid argument where all I say is shut up or go away  or whatever.   I just don't want to hear it.   I know missing my therapy appointments hasn't helped.  I do have a psychiatrist appointment in 2 weeks and a therapy appointment in 3 weeks.  But I need some help now.   I've lost all my motivation to do anything.  I've been in bed today for 17 hours and I just feel so angry.  Angry and fearful.  The only thing is that I don't know what I'm angry and fearful about.   My mood shifts so quickly and swiftly that I've lost complete control of who or what I am.  The more I try to relax the Angrier and more fearful I get.  It's like I have to stay occupied just to keep my mind occupied and keep it from traveling a million miles a second.  I just need to get back on the semi - sane track.  Right now I'm a million light years from there. ,1
 ... being that I don't know anyone here yet  but I feel like I am about to boil out of my skin if I don't get some of this out.  Last week I left the house for the first time in nearly a month and saw my doctor about the state of my head. It was the hardest thing I have ever done (that didn't involve burying a loved one) as I was brought up to believe that one shouldn't talk about one's feelings with other people. Although the sawbones made all the right noises I don't know if he even believes me. I don't know if seeing him was the right thing to do because since walking out of his surgery all I have had is deeper anxiety  more guilt  and a feeling of total and utter desperation - I think it's actually a little worse than before. I feel like this is not going to get any better  ever. I'm scared ... I don't know how this is going to end up for me. I can't see a way out. I have been depressed for a very long time but since losing my job a little while ago I have hit the proverbial bottom. I have suffered from anxiety for many years but recently it has been getting worse - I had my first panic attack last year. It doesn't matter what I try to do to stop it  all I can think about is death  pain  more death  failure  and yet more death. I have been having horrible nightmares for months (and haven't slept properly since my teens). Long story short  (ish): when I was little the Infamous They told my parents I was 'gifted'. They had high hopes for me. I won a scholarship to a good private school  where the other little girls made fun of me. Then the scholarship ran out and I had to go to a state school. Where the other little children made fun of me  spat at me  physically attacked me and eventually my parents had to take me out of school altogether. They found a better one  where the other kids continued to make my life hell. When I was about 12 or 13  I started self harming (cutting my arms with broken light bulb glass). My mother noticed once  shouted at me  and then never raised the subject again. I continued to do it until I was about 17. My dad bullied me when I was a kid; basically he subjected me to about 15 years of mingled disinterest  public humiliation  and emotional abuse. Then he did a disappearing act three years ago - leaving my mother in financial trouble. I have not heard from him since. I have wasted my life. Nothing I have ever attempted has succeeded - really nothing  and I have never been able to please the people I was trying to please. I used to think I was a talented artist (wanted to be a comic - book artist) but now I have no self - belief left. I haven't picked up a pencil in weeks and I can't even bear to look at any of my work. I can't do anything anymore and there is nobody I can talk to - my mother is my only close family and she doesn't believe in mental illness (if I mentioned it to her she would  at best  get angry and tell me to grow up / stop being so self indulgent). I have two close friends who have their own problems to deal with. I'm seeing the doctor again on Monday but I fail to see what he can do to fix the fact that I am a useless failure. I am so scared and confused. I have been crying for about a week now and it's getting really tiring. I'm scared that maybe what I think is depression is really just an excuse to attempt to explain my pathetic behavior  that I am really a hypochondriac (my anxiety is now constant and I have convinced myself I am going to die any minute from any terminal illness you'd care to name) and I'm wasting the doc's time & resources. He offered me sleeping pills but I said no as I was afraid to have such things in the house. Basically  not a good week. Sorry to vent like this but I had to get it out  ...  sorry for being so selfish. ,1
" Hi everyone. I am also a new member. I'm 22 years old and a single mother of one. I have had bipolar tendencies since I was a young child and was diagnosed at 16 or 17. The past few years since my daughter was born have been the best ones for my moods. I attribute part of that to the success I seemed to have on Lithium for two years. I stupidly went off the medicines and my thyroid medicines as well in November without telling my doctor. Lately things have gotten fairly rough. I know I have to get back in to the doctor  and I will. It's just that my life is so busy right now that it's hard to find the time (and the courage!). I'm glad I found this great site. It is great to hear others stories and to not feel alone. So  nice to ""meet"" you all.",1
 Hi everyone  I am new to this site and my name is Elie. I am a 38-year-old married mother of three girls and one angel baby boy who was born still 10/30/2003. My children's ages are 18 years old  15 years old then it would have been Conner Charles. When we lost Conner due to an underlying infection and when I had the amniocentesis the infection got to Conner and he died a month later. That was very devastating to us but I have had a lot of support with an infant grief group in our area. After we lost Conner three months later we got pregnant with Charlene and she is so beautiful. Anyway things were going good (oh I forgot to mention the fact I remarried my ex husband. We were divorced for 14 years and we got back together). One day when the baby was 11 months old my husband accidentally spilled hot coffee onto Charlene's leg and she had a blanket sleeper on so she wasn't that bad. It was bad enough but because of the way the burn looked (due to the absorption of the stupid hot coffee) the doctor had her removed from our care until they could further decide if the baby was abused. I was dumbfounded; I have known this doctor for 17 hears with my girls Marissa and Jessica  so how dare he. I was so upset  but we have a DSS worker in our lives because of my middle daughter who has mental retardation  she is in a residential home because of her behaviors which in a way was excellent for us. Our worker seen and knew Charlene before the foster care and then when she finally saw her at foster care she did everything in her power to get the baby back and we did six days later. We are constantly in and out of court now because of this and then my husband was feeding the baby oatmeal and I was warning him to be careful she flails her arms  well she flailed and knocked the spoon out of his hand and the clump of oatmeal landed on her face ... we cleaned her up not noting anything bad as she didn't cry or nothing she wanted to eat. She ended up with a blister on her cheek in the spot that the oatmeal touched. We almost lost Charlene again. I went into DSS and said my husband was no longer going to be in charge of the baby and they felt better and I also said he wants parenting classes and they liked that idea. But this is my problem  how do I get passed this. I have a counselor already but you can never have too much support so I came to this web site. I can't even make love with my husband anymore. I resent him for putting me through this when I have been the most careful mother around. We also live with his mother because financially things are tight and right now its better we do because DSS notes it is a very supportive environment and I have a lot of help which I do but I can't leave otherwise I will have DSS up my back quite often. My husband feels that sex is the cure all to depression  he keeps hounding me and hounding me and I just don't want sex. When we first got back together this second time around things were awesome and we had so much fun but then we lost Conner  then had Charlene and then these burns and losing her and going to court. I have no say whatsoever even in my own room which depresses me but soon I will try and figure out how to get out of this. All I know is my husband better respect my wishes  I just can't make love at the moment. The last time was four weeks ago. Ok that's about it for now  that's about the main stuff I am dealing with for now. Take care ,1
 I can't sleep again. My brain won't shut up. I have class at 9:00 am. I don't know if I am going to make it. When I lay in bed  all I can think about it how horrible I am. I mean  I am ugly  fat  a waste  stupid  worthless. When I talk to my boyfriend about it  he just says that I am great and beautiful. Then I just get mad at him  because I don't want to hear all that. It is not true. I have been trying to lose weight. I gained about 10 lbs over the summer  due to depression. Now all my clothes are really tight. I have been exercising and eating right for about a month  and still nothing has changed. The pants are all still uncomfortably tight  and no weight loss. I try really really hard to stay positive. But late at night  when I am alone and anyone close to me is hundreds of miles away  it is too hard. I end up hating myself. Telling myself horrible things. I hate myself. I want to be someone else. I want to be a better person.,1
 I take effexor and I have gained lots of weight. I have become so self conscious of my self. After buying all new clothes and trying to stay in staying I can't feel sexy anymore.  I love my boyfriend and he is great but I don't even feel 100% sexual with him just because I am not as fun as I use to be.   I also have dreams that I can't tell if they are real or not. I will tell someone something thinking we had had a conversation I guess it was in my sleep. I sweat like crazy yes  it is gross but what to do?  Also I really need some advice on my boyfriend. He is great supportive but he says it's hard for him to and it takes a toll on him. How can he better handle this  not that he does not do a wonderful job now  but just new advice for his sake. He is not sick with anything and I tell you I get mood swings like crazy. I am not the same girl he met and I so want to be but I can't shake this and I am afraid that it will be here forever. I can't deal with it forever it burns me out.  Please Help  oh yes I also find it hard to have friends because they do not understand I want to go out but I don't and plus most of the time I don't have the energy. ,1
 I've never posted on here before but i feel like i need to.  I no longer care about school or anything.  I want to kill myself and i keep thinking about it and I'm going to continue to think about it.  I have been doing drugs lately to try and keep from going insane in this town.  I'm alone for most of my days.  I don't really have parents to go home to  like my other friends.  I'm 16 in case anyone's wondering.  I am alone every night and i'm tired of being alone ..... there is nothing here for me  no life.  I'm going to keep doing drugs and i hope i kill myself.  I'm sure my family cares  i know they do but they can't help me.  I don't want to see a doctor  i want to die.  I have no motivation  i can't concentrate in school.  I'm not planning on being around for a while.  I can't handle being alone anymore ..... my dad is always with his girlfriend .... all the time  i never spend any time with my mom or dad ..... it doesn't really matter now anyway  it's all too late.,1
" I'm trying to go back to school after dropping out of college many years back  and I've got this real supportive boyfriend who wants to help me. Problem is  he's got this need for me to go out there and change the world. He keeps saying I need to be better than everyone in my class  and that I need to be hyper - prepared before I even start class. I don't mind boning up on the class material beforehand  but he wants to help me come up with theses and bring those to my undergrad profs for help  and he wants me to read a whole bunch of texts from my chosen field before the semester starts. He also wants me to study anatomy because  as he says ""anatomy doesn't really change""  so I can be the ""go to"" person with whom all my classmates will want to study. I'm really bright and would like to make something out of myself  but he's got such high hopes and he wants me to do way too much way too soon. I don't even know for certain what I want to be at this point - getting back into the liberal arts program just seems like a good start towards deciding and acting. All this pressure from him is making it hard for me to even take the baby steps I need to take to make anything at all happen. When I try to tell him it's too much pressure  we wind up in a shouting argument (actually  I wind up doing most of the shouting - he just has this way of pressing my buttons.) I've spent my whole life as an inactive perfectionist  and all this from him just makes it hard to break free from that. Meanwhile  he's afraid that I'm going to spend my life playing video games (a reasonable fear at the moment.) He keeps saying lately that I need to move out of childhood  but he wants to parent me. rrbleh..  is there some way to just move around him without having all these arguments  and without letting him pressure me?

" We were all given about five minutes to decipher what the fuck this meant. Now  Mr. Runge had a reputation for being a tough teacher. He wouldn't let you get away with ANYTHING. If you fell asleep in his class because you were out all night in some cornfield with a bonfire and a bottle of Jack  he'd kick your desk in such a way that your head would fly upward at warp speed and your hangover would instantly get very very bad  and then suddenly disappear. Mr. Runge had some freaky special power that students couldn't tap into. I knew what the acronym stood for. But that's only because my high school boyfriend was a year ahead of me and gave me a heads up on how the first day with the Jolly Green Giant would play out. ""He's going to write this on the board  make you feel incredibly stupid and then it will be over."" TINSTAAFL  pronounced TinStaffel. There Is No Such Thing As A Free Lunch. Runge went on to explain that ""free"" didn't exist. The ""free"" lunches at college tours were paid for when your parents registered you were charged a ""service"" fee. Or  more on my level  Clinique never REALLY has a ""Free Gift with Purchase"". Because  you see...you have to make the purchase  dumb ass! And they over charge every other product just enough so that you're really paying for your ""free"" gift. This burst my bubble. Because now  whenever I take something marketed as free  I know I'm paying some sort of overhead or some poor schmuck is working extra hard so that I can get 2.5 ounces more of my favorite shampoo for the price of the regular size! You would think that I would have held on to this knowledge while looking for apartments. While scanning the ads  I bypassed the ones that used words like ""full of character""  because I knew that meant dump and ""TLC needed""  because I knew that meant dump. The one I honed in on boasted country living  quiet  serene  pond  lots o' land and everything included! I love where I live. I can't say it enough. If I didn't think raccoons would eat me at this hour  I'd jump on top of the roof and scream to the surrounding hills ""I love you and all your coniferous smells and the creatures you shelter!"" (Yeah  apparently the rooftop would make me a tad wordy.) My landlords are awesome people. Salt of the earth. Nice  down-home  trusting folk. And  as the contract for country people reads  ""Coon Hounds Must Be Owned and Bred"". I had never seen a breed of this type until I moved here. The momma dog was so sweet and gentle and quiet. She was quite the fatty too! Then suddenly she wasn't. And in her pen were ten little squeaky pups  eyes shut tight  blindly falling into food and water dishes  only to be rescued by momma. Cute  no? Who doesn't love puppies?? (If you bring Jackson up  I'll have to cut you.) It's been about month. Puppies have found their voices. All ten of them. And even the momma is begging for a release. Tigger is in the window  constantly doing a head count to make sure everyone is in their place and not a single one wanders off into oblivion. He's exhausted. Momma is exhausted because at night she performs a constant howl that cracks my heart. She's begging to be released from those needy fucking kids for at least ONE night of respite. And I'm exhausted. Because momma won't shut up and deal with her fate and every time a puppy so much as peeps  gaymancat is all over my head doing a get-up-because-they-might-run-into-traffic-and-get-hit-by-one-of-the-four-cars-that-pass-by-here-at-night dance. So I get up. I get a drink. And the howling stops. And Tigger falls asleep in my space on the bed. Yeah...a great apartment  a story book front/back yard  nice landlords  cute puppies and SLEEPLESS NIGHTS. All included!",1
 I've been having a difficult time lately. In addition to my mental state of disarray  I have a medical condition that can affect my mood. My medication has changed lately; my body hasn't caught up the difference yet. The last few days have been particularly bad  especially at night. The familiar sensation lurks again on my upper leg. Scissors. Half-dozen lines -- my usual  though in the past I would sometimes keep cutting until my self-hatred was momentarily spent. Pressure on the blade to force the skin to gape slightly and bleed more. I am not proud. I knew it wasn't the best way to cope. I did at least take the precautions of using a sharp blade  knowing that a jagged blade could leave a jagged wound  and of lavish aftercare. I washed it out with rubbing alcohol  which causes renewed bleeding but was necessary to keep everything clean and infection-free. Covered everything with a jumbo Band-Aid  the kind kids put on skinned knees  and haven't dared to look since. Afterward  I was afraid that I was back to my old ways. I told myself in near-hysterics that this was strictly a one-time backslide. The surprising part is that I believed myself. This does not make me a cutter again. This does not mean that I have lost everything that I've gained. All it means is that I have been having an extraordinarily bad time and resorted to extraordinary behavior in order to cope. My situation will improve. My body chemistry will even out. It's better not to cut  but I am not a bad person even if I do cut. The words are stupidly simple. I don't care. They are my magic that keeps me going.,1
" I think I may have been on this forum (it looked different) back in 2002 when I had a major bout with depression and anxiety due to some serious financial worries. I've always been prone to this I guess  but I'm starting to figure out that it's big  nasty life-changes that trigger it. Well  here I go again. This time it's relationship-related. My wife and I are on brink of divorce. I found out almost a year ago that she has been emotionally involved with another man  and was no longer ""in-love"" with me. We somehow muddled through the next several months  even though I found out it was still going on  we kept ""trying"" anyway  and things were still tolerable and ok  I guess. (We still shared same bed  got affectionate  cuddled and even made love). About 3 weeks ago  I discovered that it still had not ended  and they were actually conspiring on getting together in March. Well  all hell broke loose and things got worse than ever. I'm now in a separate room  sleeping on a single bed  and I'm miserable. I resumed Wellbutrin when this all started last spring (I took Wellbutrin for about 9 months when I had my episode in 2002)  and have been taking it since. But since this really bad turn of events  I knew I couldn't take it  and to be honest  even before I discovered again  my therapist told me that I need to revisit my doctor and prescriptions because I've got some serious anxiety issues. So now I just started Zoloft (25mg/day) in addition to the Wellbutrin. I don't know how things are going to turn out. I'm in ""limbo"" while I give her ""time and space to figure things out."" The Zoloft I think started to kick in today  but not in a good way. I'm actually feeling MORE depressed when I came in this morning...I almost broke down crying in front of my computer -argh! My mood swings are horrible. All I can think about is going home and crawling into my bed and taking an Ambien  even though I hate that bed and want to be in the big bed with my wife. I almost wish at times that she would just say  ""That's it  we're done""  so I can know what is going on and just move on with my life. I may end up single and lonely anyway  but at least I'll have the opportunity to look for someone else. Right now I feel like a prisoner  being starved of basic human needs  like hugs  touches  affection. (Doesn't that sound lame from a guy???????  ) Well  anyway  here I am....here for the ride....",1
 When I was 10  my babysitter molested me many times over the course of 1 year. Many of the times she would make me dress up in girl's clothes and she would take me out that way. I'm 30 now. I still can't have sex. I still can't go out into public without having severe anxiety attacks. And when I'm at home  I find myself cross dressing sometimes. The shrinks with whom I've spoken have never been helpful so I'm hoping this post finds someone who may have some idea of what I went through and am going through now. Please write if you have any ideas to share. ,1
" Well  a little update then. For those who don't know me that well yet  (which is everybody I suppose) I'm the 20 (almost 21) year old that chose to take a break from school  due to pff what'll it be? Anxiety  depression  health problems regarding sleep/energy. I tried it again at some point  but after 2 weeks found myself to be  not cured yet. I figured it had to end  so I went looking for help. Social worker  well that's all nice and stuff  but not too helpful. Then the official psychiatrists. Well let's pick up from there; the first one  in the Adolescents department directed me to another shrink after the first intake meeting  my help question; not sure. But something was keeping me from being able to fit in the system. I also had concentration problems but she didn't want to dig into that. So this new shrink  on a different department  made me fill in some forms and we had some talks (2) and well  apparently the concentration problem IS a big issue and causing a lot of damage as well as my past (divorced parents  being bullied all my life etc etc.) Okay fine  so I says; maybe I need something to help me sleep? And she suggested I go see my house doctor and ask for sleeping medicines. Which I got  and used for two weeks now and ...nothing. Well  the first 2 days were good  the 2 after that were less good  and I don't even remember the ones after that. I woke up automatically  and sometimes sleep was okay. But after 2 weeks I'm still SO tired everyday  it's killing me. I try and keep up a new rhythm  but it's so exhausting and I feel like doing all sorts of happy things but I just don't have the energy and then I go do it anyway and I end up so hurt and tired. Now  I can't take the medicines for more than two weeks  so today was going to be my last. Well  I sort of should have read the booklet I got with it before use. It said I shouldn't take them EVERY day but every other day  and like I don't know  it says it builds up and stays in your body. Well  I'm fine don't worry. They warned about some side effects  but I seem to have been okay. However  the side effects include ALL the things I already suffered from BEFORE even taking the darn medicines!!! So it's been a complete and utter waste. This one day  I tried sleeping without medicines  and I just couldn't...just  can't fall asleep. So yeah  I had that talk with yet another shrink today  and now he wants me to see some other person. And he thinks I SHOULDN'T take sleeping medicines. So like  ARGH  people keep telling me opposite things  and now they want me to see this person  who'll help me fill in my days and get organized??? That's all cool and well and all  but I got there myself already. I figured it all out before I even started seeing these ""professionals"" and now they're telling me what I already came up with on my own??? It's another 3 week wait. And I don't know anymore. I'm confused about all this  and beginning to think it's been a huge mistake in the first place. And now that it's Spring again  I'm feeling sort of happy. So depression is still here  but  I don't notice it much...or do I? I'm still feeling so alone and my family still doesn't get me...I just want out  I just want to be away from here  which brings us back to the original problem. I'm so annoyed  and after this  today is just going to be another day that I just don't do anything useful... Sure I want to go back to school  but it takes time...I have some time  then again I don't... I had so many plans  and ARGH this sleeping problem  which is going to be my main focus now  is just so darn annoying. I could listen to countless pieces of advice  but in the end  it's just no good to me... Even the stupid sleeping medicines don't work...And every time I go see a shrink about one problem  they point me to someone else  and then another problem bothers me and they send me back but that still didn't fix my first problem. I'm like  fine I'll go fix this darn problem myself then. (I really feel like cursing  but I won't because it's not proper so I'll release some rage when I'm done here  but just know that I'm really upset and annoyed). After all  it was me who had to fix everything all my life right? So I might as well start now... haha such a laugh  I'll procrastinate till the day I die... So very tired. I can't do a thing... ugh  I'm so sick of it. I want to go sleep now  but I just know I'll wake up late in the evening and won't be able to sleep tonight. Such a drag... too young to be broken already...",1
 I'm curious to know how you raise children when you have major depression with bipolar. I feel extremely guilty that I am having a hard time being a mom. I have no energy and I am completely overwhelmed with every little task it takes to raise these kids.  My husband seems to be running out of patience with me ...... and I have really only been battling this recent episode of major depression for 3 months. Sometimes I feel like we all would be better off with me out of the picture ... whatever that takes .... because I am sick of the guilt !!! I also am suffering from 4 herniated discs in my back with sciatica down both legs. So doing things just suck. My husband made the comment today that we should sign me up for AARP ... at least we could get some good benefits. I'm 35. Plus these medications make me feel like shit! I really don't want to have to take care of anyone right now. God I'm selfish!!  Down in the dumps and full of anxiety  ,1
 I would like to say hello to everyone  I have bipolar and was doing a bit of research into my illness  which I have not done before as I have always denied having the illness. I do have funny story to tell. A few years ago now I lost the plot and lost my home wife and children as a result. Not that funny but at the time I did not know I had bipolar. New life spending loads of money racing up the career ladder (on a High) I meet this fantastic girl. We went on holidays together had some great times. After a year or two I moved in with this girl gave up my good job and planned a future for us both marriage extra. There was one thing holding us back we both hard bipolar and never told each other about or illness as we thought this could change everything. As you can imagine if she when on a high I went on a low   and when I went on a high starting companies and buying things I could not afford she would go on a low. Our relationship did not last for much longer as she would self harm and I would attempt suicide. It wasn't until I went into hospital that it all came out in the open. We are still friends but both agree that two bipolar people do not match. My doctor did smile and we did laugh about it. Anyway I am new and just want to say hi to everyone.,1
"  I am so very angry. It is eating me up. I am sick of it. It is not healthy. It costs me a lot. Yet even this makes me angry! rrARGGG! I feel like the female version of the Hulk.  Do you know how it feels to go through the cycles of feeling nuts / alone to gaining a semblance of normalcy? Well  that makes me angry. I get angry when I start to get happy. I get angry when I start to feel sad. I get angry when someone shows me love. I get angry when things go well. I get angry when things don't go well. I get angry  I get angry  I get angry.  This weekend I had this clear clear vision. I was immediately present for the first time in a long time. I felt  I breathed  I listened  I laughed. I saw. And I got very very angry.  I do not belong where I am. I do not belong. I screwed up  I fell asleep  I got depressed; and now Look at all that has changed! Nothing is the same; and I feel like I have traveled through a million miles of time in one short weekend.  This is all too much. Who the hell am I? How did I get here? What am I going to do now? Shit!!  All this time I believed I could do it alone. All this time I tried to be strong. All this time I tried to put others before myself; no matter what the cost. Now I am alone. I am like a ghost of myself. When I speak  what comes out is all wrong. I am nothing like I used to be. I am scared  I am torn  and I am alone.  My old friend looks to me: you're so great. You are here for me and you are strong. Blah blah blah ....... in reality we are just too lost souls traveling the highways alone. If I see you  I see you. But you aren't going be there for my funeral. You'll probably not even know when and where it is. You'll sleep through it and read about in the newspaper or some shit. You'll cry to the person next to you  and that will be that.  Family looks at me and says ""oh we love you so much. You are so strong and what? Are you going through creative or man pains again?"" Gee  I love you too. But you are not the answer. WE are just traveling the highways alone. You keep looking for the answer. I know there aren't no answer. We are alone: wine song and comforting arms and all.  I am angry because I know this journey is mine and I am not doing so hot. I get disorientated  I get distracted  I screw up. And you know what?! That's ok.  thanks; I needed a good angry rant :) Maybe there is someone out there who doesn't find this completely insane. If I don't speak it  it will stay inside and explode in some other form.

 I am 30 years old and I've been living with depression as long as I can remember (I think it started when I was 10) . However I was diagnosed with major depression only 2 years ago. Since then I've experienced recurrent episodes of depression. I thought that knowing what was my problem  accepting it  taking medication  seeing a therapist  working on cognitive therapy  would make my life better. Unfortunately  I still have those major episodes of depression where I'm hopeless and sad  and the only solution available to stop the pain seems to kill myself. No fun in there.  I know that depression is part of who I am  I know it's part of my life and I accept it. What I cannot accept is the fact that it's not going to be easier. I need hope. I need to hear from people who have had recurring depression (not just on episode) and have been able to deal with it and are able to enjoy life.  Please tell me it's possible. ,1
 this is my first post   so bare with me. I have been married a year and just found out some interesting news about my husband. He told me that the man he calls dad is not really his father. He told me that his mother never told him until he was 13 years old  and had to go to court to change his name. I always wondered why  he and his father never got along. His mother won't tell him who his real father is. I feel I need to help him find him  so he can close the door  and get answers to all his questions. My husband does not like to talk about feelings  he was raised in a family where no one talked about feelings and if you had a problem you  kept it to yourself. I was raised totally opposite. In ways this has left him hurt and confused. He feels like he doesn't belong sometimes. He told me sometimes he would like to know who his dad is and other times he could care less. But  it seems like it is always on his mind  when family issues come about. The man that raised him  is an issue all to his own  he is very abusive  physically  and mentally. He is always telling my husband  he is wrong and will never be able to be successful.  He has heard that all his life  but he has never believed it - he is strong and has a good heart - It just hurts me when I see him lash out. He takes all his problems out on me  I now understand why.   I have not told him  but I found out who his father is. All I have is a name. I want to tell him but don't know if I should. I don't want his mother not to talk to him if he knows - I'm very confused - I'm right in the middle and don't want anyone to get hurt. Looking for advice - or someone that can relate to this. ,1
 I've already posted on this forum but  I never really introduced myself.  So here goes:  My name is Amy  and I am 24 years old.  I have two beautiful daughters  ages 5 and 3.  I am also raising my little brother  who is 1.  I have suffered from anxiety attacks since I was 16 and became seriously depressed about 2 years ago.  I was hospitalized once ... when the doctor put me on Zoloft.  Since then I have tried Effexor XR and Klonopin (worked for 8 months) and am supposed to be trying Wellbutrin and Buspar now (scared to start them).  I self - harm when things get too hard for me  and have scars covering much of my left arm due to cutting.  I was recently dismissed from my therapy / psychiatrist due to missed appointments ... and I don't know if I am going to find another one yet.  I think about just letting go sometimes.  Nothing really helps anyways.  The one thing that depresses me the most is my fear of spending the rest of my life alone.  Men seem to think I am only good for one thing ... and I guess I agree.  I hate that I go from being okay ... sometimes for weeks at a time ... and then everything falls apart.  My family supports me ... sometimes.  At least  my mom lets me crash at her house when things are real bad.  My mom and my sister try to be there ... but they get tired of me.  I can't say I had a bad childhood ... I can't remember my childhood.  I went under hypnosis ... had a vision of my dad and became extremely afraid.  I never had a chance to go back and find out why.  Missed too many appointments.  My dad was accused of being abusive (to my mother) and having a violent temper ...  and of molesting my sister and I.  Don't remember.  My dad says my mom left us for two years when I was 2 or 3 years old and was always drunk.  Don't remember.  I spent much of my teen years drunk / high and being promiscuous ... let's just say even my mother knew I had a reputation.  Why?  Don't know.  I have never felt like I belonged ... and the past few years I have felt like I haven't really been living.  Disassociation  I suppose.  I am usually moody  never have any energy  and have started and quit school 3 times to date.  Never accomplished anything but getting my GED ... and the sad thing is ... I'm smart.   I live day to day ... never knowing if it will be a good day or a bad day.  My daughter had missed a lot of school because I can't seem to get her there by 12 in the afternoon.  My mom says she will help ... but I know I am on my own.  Neither of my daughters' father's are any help.  My dad left my little brother with me in November  sends down some money every month... and hasn't seen him since.  Some days I feel like I am on top of things ... most days I feel like things are on top of me ... and smothering me.  I've started writing my daughters a letter letting them know everything I want them to know when they are older ... just in case I'm not around.  I can't say for sure this won't beat me one day  and I want to be prepared.  I love my kids ... but also believe with all my heart they would be better off without me.  Sure ... they love me and I'm their mommy ... but not all mommies are good mommies and not all mommies deserve to raise children.  Love isn't always enough ... because God (is he even real?) knows I would die / kill for my girls.  I know the answers to nothing and have so many questions.  This is my life ...  Scared to be alone ... but I always am.  I read this somewhere and it sums up how I feel:  I'm not hungry ... but I'm starving.  I'm not tired ... but I'm exhausted.  I'm not bleeding ... but I'm dying.  So hi to everyone who is fighting the same fight ...  I just need to know that I am not alone. ,1
 I was first officially diagnosed as depressed when I was twelve  and had been depressed for two or three years before that  following the death of my younger sister. It took six years before I found an effective medication. During the time I was depressed  I was completely antisocial  had no friends  and was completely oblivious to the outside world. Now I'm eighteen  and I feel like I've missed a decade of social development. I have no friends  and no idea how to make any. It's all well and good to say just be friendly  but I don't know what that means! I can't make small talk  because I have no understanding of fashion  boys  make up  any of the things girls my age are meant to talk about  if that is what they're meant to talk about. Most of the things I know about other people my age I get from books and television  and I have no idea how accurate they are.  Please  I really need help. I've just started attending a 'normal' school (as opposed to a hospital school) for the first time since 8th grade  and I'd like to have friends  I just don't know how to go about it. ,1

 Hi  I am Ellen a.k.a. Froggie girl62  a 43-year-old female who has been depressed for life. I have been labeled as having dysthymia in the past. Although it was never officially shared with me  I believe from what I have read that I was depressed even as a child. I graduated college the first time in 1985 with a BA in Sociology with Medical Emphasis and have worked in the medical transcription field for 19 years. I have become bored with the job and dissatisfied with being forced to work from home. (Majorly boring!) Last year I started going back to school to pursue a Masters in Fine Arts in Graphic Design. This has been a huge challenge since I am brand new in the art field and most of the other students are already artists. In addition  I MUST work 40 hours a week to maintain my health insurance benefits. My mom has been my best friend and support person forever and now she has been diagnosed with lung cancer. She had surgery 2 months ago and just began chemotherapy last week. I have had an awful time dealing with this. Although she has been given a fairly decent prognosis  I am scared that she is going to leave me and would trade places with her in flash if I could. Truthfully I am disappointed every day when I wake up. I save lots of money on products to remove mascara  as the tears usually do the job. I had been on Zoloft 25 mg since the late 1990s and my family doctor increased it first to 50 and now to 100 mg. I have also started seeing a psychiatrist  only 2 sessions so far  so hard to say much about that. In the past when I went for counseling  they just gave me silly assignments and told me to go out and meet people. With my school work  I have enough assignments already. I found this forum from a post on another support forum.,1
" 'I promised I'd post regarding what I perceived to be a meltdown. As previously posted  I told all y'all that I'd been taking Neurontin. Since it wasn't prescribed for seizures but for sleep  insurance would no longer cover it because they said it didn't fit into the category of antidepressants or psychotropics  and so on and so forth. All red tape.  So  the Neurontin was stopped  through no fault of my own. Well  this disturbed my therapist. So  after almost 6 weeks off of the Neurontin  during which each week I seemed to be going more off the deep end. Meaning  I couldn't sleep  eat  had the shakes  horrific mood swings  unable to think positive about myself  and piggyback panic attacks and I subsequently was going off on some crying gig  etc.  So  on the 22nd when I saw my doctor she said with everything I was describing  that indeed I was having withdrawals. Like Duh  I already knew that. It seems the combination of the meds I was on was balancing me out and the mere change in the medicine did in fact change the way the other meds worked  or didn't work. Since I'm so hypersensitive to just about every medication  (it took forever to find the right medications and dosages to keep me on the straight and narrow) the doctor said she'd like for me to go back to the psychiatrist that originally prescribed the medications and see if they'd try another antidepressant. Another one? That didn't set well with me and I guess I was at the end of my rope. I broke down and ended up staying at the doctor's office for almost two hours while they had to give me a pill to calm me down. I felt so vulnerable and of course in my state of mind I perceived this as another crisis. I also felt extremely 'stupid' for breaking down that way. That is why I said I had a ""meltdown.""  There wasn't much I could physically do on Thursday  but  I knew I had to come back to earth. After calming down  thanks to their ""cocktail pill""  which I didn't ask its name. I agreed to see the psychiatrist. What choice did I have. I think the crying episode happened because I remembered all the bad events that happened while they were trying to find the right meds that would balance me out. It's scary. Of course while I was at the doctor's  I kept asking stupid questions like  ""why do I have to be on anything?""  Is that denial or what?  So  to cut this short. I'll be going to the psychiatrist as soon as they can fit me in.  But I need some help. I'm asking any of my friends here to give me any input you want. I've been doing pretty good the last couple of days doing the cognitive thinking and just staying busy. It's the down time that's unsettling. And obviously  if you see the time this is being posted  you know I'm not sleeping much. I am thinking positive. My doctor called me Friday to check on me. That was surprising. A doctor really calling back. So  seeing how she's my 'new' doctor  maybe we'll be compatible after all.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and for anything you'd like to add to help.  I really appreciate all of you and the joy I receive from reading and writing to you all means a lot to me. Your kindness means so much. ",1
 I'm new to any kind of discussion like this.  I'm new to any kind of support like this.  I go to Therapy once a week  or rather I did  but it wasn't really making a large difference.  I'm going to be twentytwo soon  and my life is nowhere how I wish it to be.  The funny part is that to get it where I would like it all I'd have to do is go out and get a job  start working.  I just can't seem to leave the house.  I'm not a shut in  or anything.  I love people.  I try and keep friends with everything  but I get self - conscious  all the time.  My early life was pretty difficult when it came to that  getting bullied badly for wearing glasses and being a bit of a dork.  I never really learned those little social rules that everyone else did.  Sometimes I just feel like I'm not on everyone's page  and nothing seems to help.  I became a father at nineteen  and it was difficult.  I loved my girlfriend very much at the time  and dropped out of school to support her and our daughter.  I love my daughter  she's everything.  My girlfriend left me for another man when our daughter was four weeks old  I can't help but feel insecure about this.  Logically I should know she's just not so bright or genuine a person with me  but I can't help but feel part of it was me.  She stopped letting me see my daughter a short time after  I had to go to court and battle things out.  The only accomplishment I've made in the last year that I could feel proud about was to get partial custody and three days a week with her.  I'm attentive and loving father.  I have a great relationship with my little girl.  But I can't feel good about it.  Sometimes it's like  as soon as she's gone  I forget she was even here.  I spend all day in the house  like a zombie.  I'm either on the computer or at the TV  watching baseball.  I know I want to have a healthy and happy life  and I want to have money and security for my daughter  but I can't motivate myself to do anything.  My parents were never attentive  and fight constantly  but I'm twentyone and should be over that.  Instead  it makes me more down now than it ever has.  I'm like a giant pit of negativity all the time.  I was involved with a girl  but that faded quick  and just like everything else it brought me down.  I don't do drugs  or drink  but sometimes I really want to.  Funny part is that I've never felt any kind of relief doing them in the past.  In fact  usually my insecurities and negativity are worse.  I feel like I need to get moving soon  or I'll never get moving.  I tried killing myself after my girlfriend stopped letting me see my daughter  I know how bad that was for me.  I know how I made others feel  and I know how miserable I was.  I don't ever want to get that way again.  But for some reason  and I just don't understand  I can't get myself to get moving. ,1
" new to the forum and just like to share my depression with you all.  I was verbally abused at school from the age of 9 right the way up until i left school  at the age of 10 i self - harmed because i felt worthless not wanted and thick. at the age of 13 my dad left  at the age of 15 i took cannabis to get me through school  people at school used to pick on me everyday ""for nothing"" i'd come home with tears dripping from my face go to my bedroom and cut myself with bits of glass. then at 16 the last year in school i used to get drunk before i went into school this helped me for a while it was the only thing i could rely on.  anyway i'm now 19 years old and have a list of problems such as: Social phobia / Mild Agoraphobia  Anxiety problems  Depression  Paranoia  Delusions and Insomnia ""what a list eh!!""  I don't want to play this sick board game we call life  i don't want anything from life it has nothing to offer me. i've lost count of all the times i have wanted to kill myself. I don't trust anyone i have no friends and i just want to be in total solitude. Why can't people accept the fact i don't want to socialize? Why is that so wrong? I want to die but i can't at the moment because that would hurt my Mom  i'm stuck on what to do i just want to be put out of my misery i cant see i future for me.  sorry for babbling on  i hope people reply talk soon ",1
" Read this if you want  I just needed to let this out somewhere instead of being bottled up inside me... Today I went out and took my driving test for the first time at age 18  yes...18...and I tried to keep a positive attitude throughout the whole day so I could overcome my nervousness. Anyway I got there and took the test and I failed...miserably...all day long today after that I have just became really depressed because the following things are running through my mind: - Younger kids than me pass everyday  apparently I must be f***ing retarded and worthless... All my friends passed no problem...why can't I? Why am I so stupid... Everyone had so much confidence in me and I've let them all down  I feel like I shouldn't be alive since I'm so worthless... I have only 2 more chances to pass this before I have to fill out some form saying that I'm too f***ing retarded to drive and that I need more help as I'm too stupid to try again myself...so the state has to approve my dumb a** to try again... I feel like I'm not even good enough to do anything if I can't pass some simple f***ing test that everyone else can pass...why am I so dumb? Everyone say ""It's so easy!""  ""It's not difficult  I passed my first time!""  it just makes me want to kill myself since I can't live up to the standards of this world...and may other things I just can't find words to describe...I'm not asking anyone to comfort me or make me feel better or anything  I just wanted to let this out...thanks for that...",1
" I tried to get onto the chat room  but it won't let me so I'll just post my question here. In my sociology class today my professor was talking about an experiment where several pseudomanic (healthy) patients checked into mental hospitals to record the results. The details of the experiment aren't important  but what I was wondering was about how my teacher said that the patients used fake names so that it would not be on their permanent record and so that they wouldn't be labeled as ""crazy"". So I raised my hand and asked who would be labeling them and why they couldn't use their real names  like how would people know? He said that it would be on their record and that if people wanted to find out if they have ever been hospitalized they could  particularly employers. Kind of like if you wanted to inquire about a rapist living in your town  is what he said. I wanted to ask more but didn't want to press it. So my questions are  what kind of record does this go on? Your hospital record? Your police record? When employers do a background check  does this show up? Then I was wondering  when police pull you over for speeding or something and they check your information on their computer  what comes up? Everything? If they were involved in an ambulance taking someone into the hospital  do they have that on file? Is there any way to see what's on your file? I'm just a little paranoid now about if there are going to be limitations in life now as to what I can do because of my record.  Or if anyone knows how I would be able to find out this information that would be great  ",1
 It's been so long since I've been here doubt anyone would remember me!  Lots has been happening.  My job has become busier so I've become more exhausted when I get home and I just don't want to do anything.  Then on March 4 my brother from my adopted mother died of a heart attack so had to go through that experience with my niece  his only daughter.  Then right after that my husband got really sick with pain in his belly.  We took him into emergency and they did a CT scan and could see only massive infection and couldn't tell where it was coming from.  So he was admitted and given antibiotics and scheduled for a colonoscopy.    He was also very low on potassium so he was given bags of potassium and taking pills on top of that.  His colon was clear so it was determined his gall bladder was diseased and needed to come out.  But right now it was so swollen and infected the surgeon wanted to wait until the infection cleared and swelling went down before he took it out.  So husband is now on a non-fat diet to reduce the swelling and still on antibiotics to clear out the infection.  Fortunately  being vegan  non - fat is not too hard for us to do.  He goes in for a pre - exam on Wednesday and then surgery a week later.  But through all this I haven't been doing my routing of medications and exercise and am suffering for it.  Fibro and migraines have hit me really hard.  I'm still trying to take care of my husband though by preparing his meals.  He lost almost 30 lbs through the last week of this whole episode.  In the meantime  I have an appointment Monday with a neurosurgeon to discuss if something needs to be done with my tethered spinal cord.  I've had it for years and it causes weakness in my legs and pins and needles in my feet.  It could also affect bladder and bowel functions but I haven't had that problem yet.   I've read that sometimes they cut the end of the spinal cord to get it out of the way of the vertebrae.  I'm not sure how serious my case is but my neurologist thought it was serious enough to send me to surgeons.  It's a rare birth defect I guess found in adults.  Usually they catch it in infants.  So  in a LARGE nutshell  that has been what I've been up to  ,1
" ok  so today i had another freak out. I woke up feeling good ... it was supposed to be my first therapy session (which i and my boyfriend were happy about) and then after this i was supposed to meet up with my boyfriend for lunch  check my test marks  and then go to the library with my boyfriend to study. These plans changed...  When i walked into the therapy office  they said no appointment was scheduled. All of a sudden i felt really rejected  not worthy of an appointment (like they gave it to someone else)  anxious  sick to my stomach  a little dizzy. I've been waiting since February for this appointment! I couldn't deal with my anger properly or the fact that my plans for therapy were ruined today. I started stuttering kind of i kind of got all dazed out and really sick when the receptionist wanted to schedule another appointment. So  it's tomorrow at 9am ... 9am!!! What bastards.  Anyway  so because i got all weird ... i didn't want to be around people. I called my boyfriend ... couldn't get a hold of him. I cancelled .... didn't check my marks  didn't go to the library  or lunch or see my boyfriend. I left. I told my boyfriend i had bad anxiety.  So  now he wants a ""break.""  And I've been in my room since i got home (since about 1pm) .... feeling really low and weird and lightheaded ....  I've been rocking a lot too on my rocking chair ... it's a weird compulsive soothing mechanism i have. Don't ask.  I'm mad at my boyfriend because he decided to take a break when i needed him most. Is this cold or what?! At the same time i understand: he wants his ""brain clear"" for exam studying.  Whatever. I guess it's hard being with a depressed  neurotic girl. No one wants to be with a depressed girl. Let's not kid ourselves here. ",1
 As you live life and learn new things you grow more mature. Life is not about growing up and making plans for tomorrow  it's about enjoying every moment as you're living. Happiness is the most important thing and people have forgotten that. The world is full of so many interesting things that all cost money and we believe having a lot of something is the key to happiness. And since money is the thing that buys us the things we want we sort of become obsessed with getting as much of it as we can. In my mom and my situation we've tasted what money can buy us and we don't want to go back to the way things used to be. But the thing is we were both happy then and now we're not. I've learned money cannot buy happiness. My dad and Julie don't have much money and they are happy. There is something we can all say we regret from our lives. I regret regretting. Everyday I've lived has come to this moment and even after all the things that have gone wrong recently  I can pretty much say I'm happy with they way my life has turned out. I'm happy with who I am behind my mask. I am happy with what I know and what I want to know. Lately I've been wanting to die. Actually no  I wanted to want to die. Depression is all about seeing those bad moments and ignoring the good times in your life. When you're depressed the only thing that matters are the bad times. I don't think I was stupid for wanting to want to die. When something goes wrong you tend to act out of spite as soon as it happens because you are so overwhelmed with the moment. Most people do this - it doesn't mean we're stupid it just means we got carried away and we sometimes do things without thinking. Now I'm starting to realize that the break up with Scott was a good thing. We were forcing something that wasn't making either of us happy. Of course I didn't think about either him or me and our happiness I just wanted to keep us together for as long as possible. Besides I have too many other things going on in my life right now that I need to work on and if we were still together I would have ignored these things. I don't want to become one of those people who throw their entire lives in their online journal so I won't go into everything that is going on with me. If you're my friend you know. I'm through acting like someone else in order to please people. This is my life and I'm the one living it. Other people won't be around my whole life but I will so therefore I'm putting myself and my happiness first. No more staying in one place because I'm afraid of change. I want to experience as much as I can because to me that is what life is all about. No more dwelling on the past it can't be changed - move onto today that's were things are happening and decisions need to be made. I don't want to slip off the road by looking the wrong way like I did on my driving test which by the way I failed. But that's ok  there's always next Thursday. OK enough with the things I've already learned and experienced. Onto new things  new places  and new people. I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself and wanting to be someone else. I'm going to be me again and do what makes me happy. I'm going to take advantage of the help I'm getting and I'm going to help myself get better and not depend on others to save me. And I'm also sorry to Scott  one of the reasons why I was so dependent on you was because you helped me and I thought you could save me entirely and make all the bad things go away. I now realize I'm the only one who can do that. I'm sorry I turned you into my therapist. I'm through with the break inside my hole  time to climb out.,1
 Now  I know we're all on the same bus  but I am an engineer who works with nerds all day.  These people are social misfits (not like I'm not!!!) but I can sit in my hamster cage all day and one will talk to me. They really don't talk to each other unless it's either work - related or they are talking about themselves. It's like working with robots  and they are good at it!  I am really thinking I hate geeks but I am one as well but who knows where that takes me.  Can anyone tell me how this is a healthy atmosphere for any of us? Is it common? If I leave and get another geek job  will it likely be the same? ,1
 I am 23 years old. After a long time of finally trying to get my life on track  I finally had it all together. I found the person I was meant to be with for the rest of my life and everything was so wonderful. I have never been so happy. I had known this guy for two and a half years and we always liked each other. Obstacles kept coming up that prevented us from being together; one being that I live in Kentucky and he lives in Texas. After I broke up with my ex in December  we finally got together. He was going to move here in June and it was going to be perfect. Then a few days ago he got into a horrible car crash and lost his memory. He still remembers me but he remembers me as a friend. He doesn't remember me the way we were ... in love. Now whenever I talk to him .... he won't tell me that he loves me back and he acts like I make him uncomfortable. When I tell him about the way things used to be  he doesn't seem to care. I don't he can't remember but it is so devastating for me. I'm terrified that he won't remember how much he loved me and that he will find someone else down there. I am finding it extremely hard to cope and almost feel like I can't function. I don't know what to say/do anymore. Any advice / thoughts would be so appreciated!,1
 I have been recently released from the hospital after a failed suicide attempt.  I am trying to learn how to cope with things and I recently found out that my wife has disclosed the fact that I attempted suicide to many people (about 8) that I really do not know  nor do I feel comfortable with them knowing.  As a matter of fact  I'm very upset about this.  For a little background my wife and i have not had the best relationship for the past 2 - 3 years.  about 18 months ago we moved back to her hometown after I lost my job and she could advance in her career where we are now.  I really don't have any friends down here and have lost contact with my old friends.  I have told 3 people that I attempted suicide (mom  dad  brother) and i knew that her family knew (mom  dad  2 sisters)  Now my wife tells me that she needed to deal with what I have done and she has told many of her coworkers.  She couldn't talk about this with her family or with her high school friends (which are still in the area  and I have known about 8 years).  She had to tell people that she knows I don't know very well  and of what I do know  I don't like very much.  Now my wife wants me to do more things with her coworkers and I feel very uncomfortable around them.  Am I being too sensitive about this?  Not realizing my wife's needs?  Or am I justified in my being upset?  I will not be able to come back to this board until Monday (tomorrow) evening so I can't post any replies until then.   ,1
" Hello again everyone  my real name is Mike. I found this site a couple weeks ago but have been pretty busy with the holidays and a new job. So I thought I would post a bit more about myself. This isn't easy since I am not that good at talking about myself but here goes. I am 35 years old and have been depressed as long as I can remember. When I was 12 or 13 years old I remember sitting in my closet in my room with the doors shut writing a suicide note. After talking to a friend of mine about 7 years ago who started going to a therapist and taking Prozac  I decided to go get help. I didn't even know to call it depression until I started talking to him. I was diagnosed with Dysthymic Disorder and have been on and off a couple different kinds of medicines  one of which was Effexor and the other one I can't remember the name but it started with and S. I have a bad habit of remembering every bad thing that has ever happened to me and continually go over and over it in my head. I will bring up something with my brother or sister and they say ""I can't believe you remember that"" and yet sometimes I am lucky I remember my own name. I just started a new job recently and will not have insurance until the end of January. I am seriously considering going back to a therapist and possibly getting on medicines again. I am tired of carrying around this baggage and want to do something about it. There are so many things I want to do with my life and seem held back by my depression. I found this site one night after feeling really depressed over something that I can't even remember now in the hope talking to people who knew how I felt and what I was going through.",1
" NOTES FOR A SUCCESSFUL EFFEXOR WITHDRAWAL  After doing research on this board and others  I prepared the following withdrawal regime and carried it out  making slight adjustments as I went along.  It worked for me  although the withdrawal was not easy.  I share it with you all in gratitude for all your advice and sharing over these past months. I hope it will be a help for you preparing to come off Effexor  1. MY SITUATION:  a. Length of Time of Effexor: 5.5 years  b. Dosage: 150 mg XR  c. Reason for Effexor: TMJ  myofascia and migraines due to a displaced jaw disc  lock jaw and stress.  d. Other medications: Flexeril (periodically over the years but not in past year when things are ""bad""); Trazodone  for sleep; vitamins and herbs as needed.  e. Status: Age: 43  Height 5'-10""; Weight: 160. Married  no kids  work from home.  f. Reasons to Come Off: Generally feeling better with the help of physiotherapist; life situation has become low-stress and stabile (secure job  good marriage  work from home); side effects of Effexor becoming irritating  especially the emotional distance from my own thoughts / emotions; and simply feel that I cannot be on this drug for the rest of my life.  2. MY WITHDRAWAL REGIME  Procedure:  Drop my dosage by 18.75 mg (XR) every two weeks. 4 months total time to get to zero. Divided 37mg pills into two parts to equal 18.75  depositing each part in new empty vegetable gel caps (available at health food store).  In general:  a. No caffeine -- not even decaffeinated coffee.  b. No alcohol.  c. Exercise every day (heartbeat up for 20 minutes or more).  d. Steam Room / Sauna / Hot bath or long hot shower every day.  e. 40-50 hour work weeks  nights / weekends off for ""down time"".  Daily:  a. Vitamins (one dosage each in the morning and night): B Complex (50 mg); C (1000  mg); E (400 iu); Omega (2000 mg); Glucosamine Sulfate; 8 glasses of water.  b. Continued with my Trazodone medication for sleep during entire tapering process  took no Flexeril.  Experience during each tapering of 18.75 mg:  First 24 hours: no side effects.  48 hours: very bad day: grumpy  anger  rage (for someone relatively sweet natured); nausea  dizzy  balance problems  headache; when moving head too quickly would become nauseous; body pains  disrupted sleep with periodic nightmares. The main thing is to be as far from other people as possible since any conversation would rub me the wrong way. Asked wife to take nothing I say personally  agree with whatever I say  or simply ""get out of my way"". Eventually we found sending her away for the day shopping or whatever to be the best. On these days I would plan to do a lot of non - thinking busy work around the house: fix things  garden  etc. Spent extra time at gym and in steam room.  72 hours: very low energy  dopey  foggy  wanting to stay in bed  body pains. My energy would then slowly gain over the next few days. Some of the above side effects would appear briefly without warning between drops in dosage (anger  bad nights sleep  sluggish).  Once at zero mg.:  Symptoms:  All of the above  but slightly increased in all areas.  Acute allergy symptoms -- sneezing  headache  stuffed up from morning to night -- aches and pains. I took Benadryl during this time which helped a lot.  Detox Period:  Now I had to remove the toxins from Effexor from my body. Regime:  a. Steam Room / Sauna / Hot bath or long hot shower twice every day--with cold shower breaks in between heat sessions to mimic the aspects of fever.  b. cleanser: Triphila and Psyllium husk powder twice a day  c. Dry brush my skin (the skin holds a 1/3 of the body's toxins)  d. 5 day juice fast  with 2 days before and after of raw vegetables/fruits only. Stopped all medications  vitamins  benadryl  colon cleanser  everything during this juice fast. I scheduled the fast approximately 2 weeks after stopping Effexor.  e. Exercise regime every day.  3. AM I NOW IN THE CLEAR?  Here I am 4 weeks after the end of Effexor (and Trazadone -- which I replaced with melatonin). I continue to take vitamins and will do so for quite a while. So ... How am I feeling?  - I don't have words to describe how wonderful it is to have my feelings  emotions and mind back  where I feel that my moods are my own and not manufactured by Effexor.  - Allergies continue to haunt me daily  but each day it gets a bit better  and I take less benadryl.  - No need to remember pill times is wonderful  less dry mouth.  - Still a bit ""low energy""  but it gets better each day.  - Mood is upbeat  feeling hopeful and looking forward to clear windshields everyday!  I hope this help those of you out there planning to come off this drug. I am grateful for Effexor for all it has done to help me over the years. I wished they warned me about the withdrawal. I am grateful for all your suggestions and comments that helped me research and put this regime into place. It worked for me and I probably wouldn't change a thing if I were to do it again. ",1
" If you don't want periods (or PMS) at all there is the 3 monthly injection - Depo-provera - in the UK. It doesn't work the same for everyone (like all medicines) but for me it stopped all periods and kept my depression down to such a level that I could function ""normally"". I stopped having the 1 week mood swings  1 week misery  1 week mood swings  1 week ok cycle. If that's not an option for you there is a herb supplement that I tried called Agnus Castus. It seems to have beneficial effects for most ""women's problems"" from aching breasts to full blown menopause. And it can have the side effect of weight loss (not a bad thing for me ) I was on it for ten years at a time and got to the stage where when I came off it and had a period again I had completely forgotten what they were really like! And things have wings now. The PMS didn't cause my depression but it certainly didn't help it. Hope this is helpful",1
 I have always felt different  i guess i am a little weird  loner  gay  but at the same time smart loving  people admire me and respect me . i felt depression back in 96. tried different medications  until  effexor worked for me  then i felt good for several years now depression has come back again  and with much vengeance. it took my soul and mind  I am back with my partner after a short break up which i think caused the monster to come back  i lost motivation in life and i called my ex to come back into my life since i was feeling suicidal  he claims he loves and will be there for me  and he has been a great deal of support for me. i'm taking cymbalta for 4 weeks now but my doctor says it will take 2 more weeks until we decide which medication i should stay with. in the meantime there are suicidal thoughts  running in my head as well as some of hope. i would hate to miss out on my son's high school graduation  or my own graduation from the RN program. as a nurse i know that there is hope  but no matter how much knowledge you have you will always feel lost and helpless when depression is in your body. my message is that we should be patient and continue to do positive things because at the end  all this mess in our heads  will only seem like a period of time where we were sleeping or we blanked out  i am hurting so much and i know there are many more hurting out there  but let's be kind to ourselves and give ourselves words of appreciation and affection  over and over  take care of yourselves and be PATIENT  just like i will be.  God is there watching over us and will not let us perish  unless we want to.,1
 before i start i want to apologize to everyone for not offering much support recently. For those of you not in a good place right now  i hope things start to ease for you soon. Sending my love to you all and i am thinking about everyone.  Lycan hope your hangover is well and truly gone and that you are ready for another week at work.  Well i went to the GP on thursday and she was really lovely  really listened to what i had to say and she wants me to go away and consider going on antidepressants  before i make a final decision.  While there she spotted a mole on my arm and she looked through this little gadget. She thinks its skin cancer (Melanoma) and has sent an urgent referral to the dermatologist. So i am now waiting on an appointment for a biopsy. I am kind of upset about it  i know they can probably get rid of it  but it doesn't stop the panic attacks and anxiety.   So all in  I am not in a good place right now  but hopefully things will start to get better soon. ,1
" I began taking Lexapro 2 months ago and have fallen into a state of deeper depression.  What was at one time characterized purely by chronic migraines has turned into anxiety  sleeping continuously  etc.  all the classic depression symptoms.  The scary part is  I'll just have a thought pop into my head like ""I have all the pain killers in the house to kill myself right now."" Or  I thought  a bath sounds nice  then this sinister thought  ""just slip under the water"". My rational brain is saying I would absolutely never hurt myself  so why these thoughts?  WHAT THE HECK ??!  My Doc is thinking it's a side effect of the the Lexapro and is taking me off of it.  Have any of you had this experience with this or any other medication?  What if this happened while I was driving a car with my kids??  I truly feel psychotic!! ",1
" I am not able to do breath meditation myself  so I'm a fine one to talk  but I've read that it works. The thoughts will come  no matter what you do. Supposedly the trick with breath mediation is that it gives you distance on the thoughts  helps you ""stand back"" from them a bit  and feel the accompanying emotions but not get as carried away by them. This reinforces your ability to know that they're just thoughts  and they will go away if you don't act on them. And supposedly either with breath meditation or without  there's an element of ""fake it till you make it"" at work here. It's been shown that ""acting out anger"" as a therapeutic tool actually makes getting angry easier than letting go of it  because it maintains the neurological pathways that anger uses. One meditation teacher calls it ""rehearsing anger"". So supposedly if you replace negative thoughts/feelings with positive ones  like caring for the part of you that is angry and hurt  then eventually your brain will reprogram itself to think and feel positive things. Breath meditation has become a non-religious phenomenon in recent years  like yoga. Three books that are just good reading anyway are ""The Art of Happiness"" by the psychiatrist Howard Cutler with the Dalai Lama  ""Destructive Emotions - How Can We Overcome Them?""  by the psychologist Daniel Goleman with the Dalai Lama  and ""Anger- Wisdom For Cooling The Flames""  by Thich Nhat Hanh  all of which discuss breath meditation as a simple practice for ""mental hygiene"" as opposed to a ""religious practice"" of any sort. Supposedly the Dalai Lama was really surprised to hear that ""self-loathing"" is common in Western culture  because it was so uncommon in Tibet- there was just no concept. The point of all this is  with or without meditation  is that if you notice a negative thought or emotion when it arises  rather than struggle with it to try to put it out of your mind  you should just quietly label it as ""negative thought"" and let it go away  and/or replace it with a positive thought  like ""caring for the wounded child within you"". (It's odd to notice that John Bradshaw  the ""king"" of ""healing the wounded child""  and Thich Nhat Hanh  a Vietnamese Buddhist monk  say the same thing about this.) But it's being said that there's a great similarity between Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and meditation practice  because meditation practice recognizes negative self-talk and replaces it with positive self-talk  and supposedly conditions the brain to react in positive ways. In ""Destructive Emotions"" there's a part about brain imaging that shows that people who meditate are activating more positive parts of their brains. And again  these books are just good reading anyway. But like I say  easier said than done. Supposedly it works for some people. I can't do it  but some people can. Maybe you can. If nothing else  all these works  including Bradshaw  are good reading and you may be able to develop positive mental habits and replace the negative mental habits with them. Both breath meditation and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy have been shown to be good adjuncts to recovery from depression  even if the depression itself is being treated with medication.",1
 Do good guys actually exist  because i'm beginning to lose faith. Every guy i have taken an interest in has been bad for me. I'm only 18  but i have slept with 7 people  which i think is a lot and makes me a slag. I started dating at the age of 10  and was with that guy until 15.  I've done the whole dating thing now  i just want someone to take care of me and try to understand me. I've only ever been a sex toy to men ... and i hate it. Not one guy has actually wanted me ... they just wanted sex.  Everyone keeps telling me that i need to have fun  go out  get laid. But that isn't my style ... i want someone to hold me tight and tell me everything will be okay ... but i fear good guys don't actually exist for people like me. ,1
 I am new here.  Decided to look up some info on the withdrawal effect of Effexor and decided that it was time to check out support as well.  I have suffered from depression since I was very young but was not diagnosed until my early twenties (I am 33 now)  I was not medicated until my husband decided he didn't want to be married anymore and the bottom fell out of my life.  At the time I needed something to help balance me out a bit.  I should have been medicated a long time ago :)  I still have times where it hits me but not nearly as severe as it used to.  I describe it as my black cloud coming over me.  I tell people when it's there as I am very open about my depression as I feel it may help someone else.,1
 Help! I just want to cut  and cut  and cut.  It feels so good.  So far I have managed to maintain some sort of self control and only cut my wrist and genitalia.  I'm afraid because I have the whole weekend to myself except for a few things I'm doing with friends.  My mind is full of strange thoughts.  I'm sorry I was so descriptive.  I really would like it if someone would respond.  I'm not seeing my therapist until Wednesday and I got into a big fight with my husband on Friday about my depression.  He said I make him depressed.  He doesn't know how to handle me.  He thinks that depression is a choice not a disease.  He wants me to talk to him about my problems like I talk to my therapist. I can't.  He says things like I throw him a guilt trip.  He is one of my problems.  He damages my self -esteem. ,1
 I'm 19 an architectural student life's meant to be all great right? everything in my life is so good but I'm always depressed and sometimes i go throw these stages where i cry out of nowhere for no particular reason! i used to cut myself and i really need to but my insecurities about my scars are holding me back i need to find happiness soon or I'm just going to give up on life I'm thinking way too far into the danger zone and almost suicidal! great here i go again bloody crying! well I'm just looking for some around my age who can relate and who i can talk to! and I'm a great listener so if there's anyone out there?,1
 I have been dealing with no self confidence and low self esteem for some many years now I can't count them all. Things have really hit rock bottom. After 6 years my partner has left me. At 26 I feel I'm going to die alone. All I want is to settle down  get married and have lots of babies but I pushed him away. Why did I do that? I see no light at the end of this tunnel. I feel completely alone. I've cried so long and so hard but it doesn't change the empty feeling I have inside me. ,1
 Hey all  I moved away from my home town 17 years ago and have only gone back for short visits and never met up with any of the people I used to hang around with. These girls still live in the town and still after all these years talk of me and not nice either  the reason I know this is because another friend told me. I am not putting them down but the only reason I can think of is because they are angry and jealous of me as I have been on a sort of adventure instead of staying home and being a single mum. I really can't think what I did that was so bad to them that they still put me down and hate me. They even shouted out my name then said is a **** I was with my mum and it was awful. I was excited about moving there but now I am dreading it and I am petrified incase they decide to start making my life bad when it will be a struggle educating my family on my illness. I just don't know what to and I would appreciate any advice please. HiddenLady,1
 Well  I'm a sixteen year old girl  and my name is to be unknown  so just call me Kat. I think I have depression  and others have told me that I may  because I have mood swings  I constantly think of death / suicide  and I do cut myself  a lot. When I'm sad I will cry and I will throw up sometimes on purpose. I have issues with the way I look  because I am overweight  and I am insecure about my weight. I have moments where I break down at school in the girls' bathroom and I do carry a razor blade around with me and I will cut myself at school. I have scars everywhere on my arms and some on my legs  and the scars do overlap each other. I have a friend who I like to talk to  and sometimes it helps. I have tried to talk to other friends  but they don't care. So yeah  my parents know I cut  and they're also thinking about getting a divorce and taking me away from the school I love.. I don't know if anyone here cares. Or if anyone here thinks I'm just another fake teen crying for attention .. but I don't care  this is what's with me  and it does hurt..,1
 I think letters are a wonderful way to communicate. That way you don't say anything without thinking about it first. I wasn't clear if your mother actually read the letter or not. If she hasn't  I might suggest approaching the letter with just the first issue of the way she treats you (without the father issue) in one letter. That might open dialogue and allow you guys to focus on fixing that first. I understand your fear of authority figures. When I was that age (I'm 31 now) I couldn't talk to anyone of authority. My mom  who was shy herself had to do that kind of stuff for me. Could another one of your relatives go with you to take your drivers test? Nana or Sonny who you mentioned in the letter? If it helps to hear  I did get over my fear of authority figures and sometimes I go overboard and challenge them (to make up for lost time?). I never had psychotherapy  but I wish I had. So don't discount it  nip it in the bud if you are able to. One other question I have is...is your mother ALWAYS this way or does she show moments of tenderness  sympathy or interest in your life? I think that if you've seen the mom in her in the past  it sounds like she has some internal problems that she takes out on you  but have nothing to do with you. Don't worry about how you should be at this age...everyone has their own time clock inside. If we were all the same  this would be a very very boring world. You sound like an interesting  thoughtful man. I wish you could see that.,1
 Hello  I think this is where I introduce myself...I'm 34 I've been suffering severely with depression since I was 6. I've not yet been properly diagnosed  most likely because I have to go to the county and I live in the poorest county in California. I know I'm EXTREMELY obsessive compulsive  I've been told I'm major depression  ocd  add  and now may possibly be bipolar of the severe kind....oh. boy. I'm confused as hell. I have no mentally ill friends and the others just take advantage of me. If I try to talk to my mom she breaks down  she is trying more now  it's just recently they really started believing I'm really ill and not jus a hustler. The medications have been tearing me apart  one almost gave me a heart attack. I would really like to talk to someone who understands me with out having to go to the 3rd floor again. Maybe there's someone out there who has a sensitivity to these medicines too ... who can help? so far some take off the edge  but I always end up breaking down and EXPLODING. I can't hold down a job  and with the state off the economy I can't get disability...so sometimes It's the streets. I'm REALLY TIRED  can anyone feel me? Thanks for your time ,1
" This is a really great forum and nice to know there are other men out there willing to help as they know what it's like. It's also funny how sometimes what you think you are doing and what other perceive are totally different. For example  my wife has recently stated that she feels like she's living in a ""glass jar."" What she means it that due to my depression and anxiety she  at times  feels like she has to act or say things differently because of how she thinks I'm going to interpret them. Whereas all I want is for her to act normal and do and act as she was and let me deal with the insecurities and issues. I hope this is making some sense to some of you and if so  any suggestions on what to do? Thanks!",1
" I read ""The Art of Happiness"" a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it. The Dalai Lama is something else. I've forgotten a lot of it but I do remember him saying that we should strive to be unswayed by emotion so that we don't differentiate between good things happening or bad things. I am the opposite of this. When good things happen I feel good. When bad things happen I feel bad. I loved what you said about there being no such thing as self loathing in Tibet. I wonder if this means there is no depression. I've always wanted to be a monk. Maybe that's the answer. Thanks for the interesting post Harlequin. I will now go and Google breathing meditation. By the way  can anyone tell me how to post partial quotes? Do I have to erase the bits I don't want posted after hitting +quote or is there another way?",1
 I just need to rant because I see what my life could be and what it really is and just get so frustrated! I want to be / feel normal! Instead I keep a part time job I hate when I should quit so I can focus on my wedding and school and other things. I'm failing horribly in school and there is no reason why I should! I have a learning disability but I should try harder  and I only do part time studies! Our wedding is coming up and of course planning is stressful but I want to be more organized.  My fiance each have close family members who recently got very ill & are so worried and trying to cope and take care of them. Sure we have a lot on our plate but I see people with the same amount of stuff at the same time!  For example I knew a person in high school who was always on the honor roll  took an extra night class  had a boyfriend  friends and social life  and a job! Then in University the same thing as well as scholarships.  I would crumble under the pressure! I'm so sick and tired of doing a half assed job of managing my life.  I HAVE TO quit that job  stop watching tv when I should study  organize my things rrARRRRGGGGG I'm just so angry. I'm 25 years old and a total mess. I don't know what I did to deserve the angel who will soon be my husband  but I'm so thankful that he keeps me afloat & my head on my shoulders. ,1
 I find it very hard to make decisions. I know there's a little bit of anxiety behind every decision  but it's starting to control my life. I'm trying to find a new job and a new home. I'm also always thinking about a breakup with my girlfriend of 4.5 years. I know these are big things in my life  which lately has been causing a tremendous amount of anxiety/depression/panic. I'm 32 and I don't think I was raised with the correct tools for dealing with life sometimes. For others it seams so much easier. I'm depressed at my current job/home. I need to change. I'm afraid of change. It's a vicious cycle. Can anyone relate? What works for others?,1
 OK  for you guys out there- I apologize ahead of time... It's that time of the month for me - and I thought I was doing pretty well until this afternoon. It's like my hormones  brain chemicals and whatever else have done a complete 180 on me. Driving home today I prayed I would just make it safely because I was starting to feel so out of control. I want to scream (which I can't because of where I live) or break things- or whatever else to get this anger out!!!  I don't even know where it's coming from!! All I know is everything is pissing me off!!!!!!!! Has anyone else ever felt like this? What do you do? I can't cry- the tears won't come. I'm thinking about watching a show I like  but I don't seem to like anything right now. Also  I'm supposed to be working from home right now  which is the last thing I want to do. I just want to take some Klonopin and make myself chill and go to sleep. I won't  though  because I'm still feeling responsible at this moment  despite my feelings of rage. I just want to get rid of these feelings!!! Any ideas?? ,1
 I'm 16 and I've thought about suicide some  never tried yet. I'll tell you about myself. I'm in high school ...   just got my license. I've been to two shrinks  neither for depression but a anger problem  though I don't have one  just Mom and me fight and we've always been close. No one has ever known that I've thought of suicide except when I was in junior high and it wasn't really much true  sure a little but I was more agreeing with my cousin when she said that she has thought of such. Now I've been recently noticing (for a small bit months now) how I have been having some I guess you would say symptoms (pardon my spelling) of depression and all. Especially I've been losing interest in things and feeling guilty over everything and that's the most extreme ones  I have some others too. I've taken online tests and it says that I may have depression. But I can't believe I do. I mean why would I have depression. I would just guess I'm making it up to myself or something. We'll I've always been interesting in  psychology stuff like personality disorders  so maybe I'm just reading into it wrong or something. That would probably be what a shrink would say so I don't want to go to one  plus I don't really like talking to them. Another thing is one of my friends just attempted suicide  lucky survived and if I say something to someone they would think I'm just saying such because of that. I've felt like this before that though .... another thing is I'm a Christian and Christians shouldn't feel this way  right? Can someone help me figure out if I'm just making this up in my head!!!,1
" I'm a 33 year old man with a history of depression (I was diagnosed when I was 10) and of ""standing apart"" -- not refusing to fit in out of some sense of rebellion  but not fitting in simply because I couldn't. I have never been married. I've had only one long term relationship -- it was long - distance and very turbulent for both my partner and I (the relationship ended three years ago). To this day I wonder why I don't ""measure up""  why I can't seem to find my place in life. While not physically stunning by any means  I never thought I was hideous  either -- though my looks have most often been pointed out to me as a shortcoming  so that's the explanation I tend to go with most of the time. When I hit my teenage years  panic disorder became a problem  too (as I realized how little control I had over my life and the way it was going to turn out). At the beginning of each year  I stand back and take stock of my situation  asking myself: where am I right now? Which direction am I headed in from here? What are my options? Up until now  I could always find some reason to be at least a little hopeful  to keep going -- but this year I can't. I've been out of work for a long time  the panic attacks are getting bad again  I've had a number of relatively minor but still worrisome health problems in the last few months -- and worst of all  after so many years  I'm still alone. There are no prospects out there; no one wants to be with me. I'm in a lot of pain and I don't know how to make it better. This is not just a temporary slump  it's my whole life  but it hurts even worse now than it used to. ",1

I don't know why I thought that  I was ok. Maybe because  I had been drug free in my treatment for the last 2 1/2 yrs  or because things didn't seem so chaotic this time before someone noticed  I was  ""different""? There was NO one thing  I could determine that triggered me this time and it's worse now than it was the last time. I am hoping that perhaps some of you might be able to assist me in understanding what happened   because quite frankly I thought  I would be ok after the last treatment I had ... and it was all in vain",1

" Hello. I am a 40 year-old woman  and I'm feeling quite lost right now. I've always been sort of depressed  but have never been given a formal diagnosis. That may change tomorrow. I have an appointment with a shrink. My psychiatrist put me on Prozac 3 years ago. I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 34  and needed some help getting past that. I am adopted (a biggie for relationship issues)  was married at the age of 18  had 3 kids by the time I was 40  and I'm having a hard time transitioning to my new stage in life (sort of empty nest syndrome  I guess) I should be thrilled with my life. I make oodles of money  my kids are all fairly successful & just about on their own  but I'm miserable. My husband and I are in a sort of ""friendship"" relationship  I could care less if he stays or goes. I started having panic attacks after my 40th birthday few weeks ago; I actually thought I was having a heart attack. So now  I'm on 30 mg Prozac & .05 Klonadine (1/2 pill at a time) 3 times a day. I can't quit crying. So... how long does a psychology test take. How long will it take for them to diagnose me with something? These drugs aren't doing a whole lot. Any help would be appreciated.",1

 I am a 26 year old female that has had depression since i could remember i started cutting myself in high school and stopped when i graduated with very few relapses but for the past year i have been wanting to i just recently had a son who is my pride and joy but my son is the only thing that i have in my life.  his father is not around and everything in my life just seems to be getting worse.  i constantly stare at the razor in my hand and just want to release all this pain and  sorrow and loneliness that i feel but i can't bring the razor down because i can only think what my one year old son would think if he knew what i wanted to do i just need to know another way to release the pain cause i can not figure anything out i know how cutting makes me feel released but i know that i can't do it anymore.  help me,1
 i'm not really sure what i want to say here. I was sexually abused by my brother from the age of 4 until i was about 17. He hung himself when i was 20. i'm 34 now and just finding it hard to get a handle on life. I never really thought of what happened to me as being a big deal but my partner has made me think again about what happened in the past. my most formative years were disrupted and i believe i am still suffering as a result.  I suppose i am just wondering if anyone has any advice or knows of anyone who was in a similar situation. I am in counseling at the moment and am just starting to face my demons. I came off my depression / anxiety medications. i felt they were stopping me from really feeling and i felt i needed to be fully aware of my feeling in order to work through this and be able to let go. at the moment i don't see an end to all this. ,1
" I am starting to feel really frustrated with life because there are things I don't understand about the world. My problem is I think too much and I wish I was off in space thinking about a night out in the city but I'm not. Instead I focus on every negative thing I can. I would never kill myself and because I wouldn't do that I really want to know how I can get over all this shit and be happy with what I got. I don't know if it's my mind playing the victim but I feel like everyone close to me is out to hurt me. For example I am 20 and I don't have a car. I can understand I should already have it like two years ago but this a prime point for my parents to pick on me. For some reason my mom got herself into a bit of a mood and started having a go at me which caused me to end up in tears because she told me I am hopeless and so are all my brothers and that I am an embarrassment. This is all because I don't have a car! She's usually really caring but she came out with all this stuff. Am I going crazy or is it really a huge deal to not yet have a car? Is it worth hurting your daughter over?? Then there is my supposed ""boyfriend"" who picks on me about my weight. I am not as thin as I once was. I've put on about 10 kilos in 3 years. I know it's not a good thing but for ages everything was about my weight. I used to weigh 54 kg which is tiny and now I am 64kg. My boyfriend is at university and thinks that my life holds no meaning because I apparently have no hobbies and I just turn up to my ""little job"".  I have friends that are completely selfish and I always end up paying for everything and they can't even do me a simple favor. I don't want to play the victim because I've been a punching bag for so many people who themselves have played the victim so it's nothing I would aspire to be.     I could write pages and pages and pages of how annoyed I am but I thought I'd just give an idea. I'm sick of people being the way they are to me and making me out to be a energy drain.

" During my high school years I was always a little ""klooster"" never went out that much never did anything bad ..... When I left school I moved to Johannesburg and from there moved to my mom in Mpumalanga  South Africa  a day before my 21st birthday I got raped ..... the most terrible feeling ever  I was not wearing any revealing clothes  had jeans a t-shirt and tekkies on  how do you explain this. I always believed that those girls  wearing the most revealing clothes are the ones that ask for it  but do they really?  I can not see how any one can ask for this  it is the worst thing that can ever happen to you.  A few months thereafter I had to have an abortion due to the fact that I could not keep the baby ...... I was way too young  I never and still up until date  don't believe in this type thing  but now I think?  Was it the right thing to do  will you ever be able to face the child the same way you will face a child born into a happy and wonderful marriage? I also suffer from depression  high blood pressure and all those wonderful things  I got married in December 2005 and due to me and my fiance having a big argument with my dad  he never walked me down the aisle on my big day and me and my husband had to pay for the whole wedding  I feel awful  but the things my dad said and done can never be forgiven.  My stepsister had a baby at the end of December and she is getting married now in April 2006  guess who is doing and paying for her wedding .....

I battle to have healthy sex  due to the fact that every time I close my eyes  I see this person on top of me  forcing himself in  I feel guilty to have kids  how can I have more  if I killed one? How can I bring up a family if my own family is up to shit ....  I often find myself wondering why? Why me  why am I the one crying myself to sleep  why do I have to keep myself in tone  to prevent a stroke  especially at my young age?? ",1
" Well I'm new here so here goes nothing.  I have been diagnosed clinically depressed  along with obsessive compulsive disorder.  I'm 32 years old.   I've been divorced once and have since re - married.  I have 2 children  7 year old boy (stepson) and 4 1/2 year old girl.  I work for a state government agency repairing computers.  So far so good right?  Well the major problems I'm having is becoming a social recluse.  I have a REALLY hard time ""letting things go"".  In 2005  I lost both my sister (suicide) and my father (heart attack)  and those events only added to the trauma I'd been going through.  I live in a small town  so when I went to the doctor about possible ADHD (i was moody  couldn't focus on work  couldn't complete tasks on time etc)  they determined I was bipolar and put me on Effexor and Wellbutrin.  Well that just did absolutely nothing.  In fact my anger with the world increased dramatically and I had rage episodes that about destroyed my second marriage.  I've had a lot of rage in the past.  Recently I haven't had any outbursts.  I'm currently taking Cymbalta and Celexa and that seems to be a good combination.   But I still have a hard time going to work  and functioning throughout the day.  I'd rather stay at home  in my bedroom  away from people most of the time.  That's what bothers me.  I'm on antidepressants  but it doesn't seem to help me get motivated to face the world.  Does that come from within?  Is there no magic pill that will all of a sudden make me feel confident?   I guess that's good enough for now.  I have a ton of mental history but don't want to flood anybody.   ",1
" Hi  sorry if this turns into a lengthy post  but I could do with some advice  and I think this is probably the best place to ask. Firstly  I should point out  I am a 19 year male. My problem is that I am concerned by the physical effects the depression is having on me. I have probably been suffering from depression for several years  but I only sought medical help last November after I had a breakdown. The doctor has prescribed me with Fluoxetine  and I am taking 40mg per day. I originally started off on 20mg per day  but after I told the doctor what I will tell you now  about 2 months ago  he ""upgraded"" my status to severe depression  hence the increase in dosage. I can appreciate that my mindset is slightly biased towards feeling negative  and expecting the worst  but nevertheless I can't help but feel my symptoms might be the result of an even more serious problem. The medication has helped my mind (even though I still have plenty of lows  they aren't always as severe as they were 6 months ago)  yet my physical health is deteriorating to the point where that's the main factor preventing me from accomplishing day to day tasks. My symptoms are as follows (and they may be generalized  I'll admit): Constant fatigue  even after plenty of rest; constant aching throughout the body; generally feeling very weak  lacking energy and strength  e.g. carrying shopping home can leave my arms in agony; loss of coordination  I have become very clumsy  always knocking glasses over  or dropping things for no reason; occasional loss of balance  usually when getting up  or starting to walk from a stand still; joints are feeling slightly stiff  they still move  but I can feel more resistance than normal and they get very tired very quick if was to use them  or even just hold my arms straight out in front of me; and for me  the worst symptom is an almost constant tremor in both hands and arms  which sometimes spreads throughout the body. If I attempt slow  fine movements with my hands  the tremor becomes very clear and results in jerky movements. Also  I like to exercise  yet after all exercises  even low intensity ones  the trembling seems to intensify. I doubt it is anxiety  as I still shake when I am calm  relaxed and immobile. I know I can't expect I diagnosis  but I would appreciate it if anyone can tell me if the severity of the physical effects I am experiencing  is quite common  even when the mental state is much more relaxed and beginning to recover? Thanks for any help",1
 I see no way out  except to stop this life. I am 59 years old and have not worked since 2004 due to depression and anxiety disorders. I live on social security disability. I barely have enough money to live on. I lost all my savings after losing my job as a teacher. I did make my car payment  but I could not pay my other bills. I have about $14 000 in debts now. I have not been able to work due to depression and panic attacks. I should try to work  but my teaching credential has expired. I would have to move to another area to find a teaching job now  after being let go from my last job here. I am afraid to move away. At my age I should have savings and be ready for retirement (and have retirement). But I have nothing. I rent a room here in expensive Santa Barbara. I am stuck in fear and nothingness. I'm scared and I keep thinking of suicide  but I'm afraid it will not work and I will be worse off. Is anybody in a situation like mine? Does anybody have any words of wisdom?,1
" Is anyone taking Lamictal?  After trying almost every available antidepressant through the years  my psychiatrist is having me try Lamictal.  (I'm 34  started taking medications when I was 18 -- haven't really taking anything for about five years  with the exception of Zoloft back in January  which had terrible side effects.)   Right now I'm using the starter pack of Lamictal.  I took 25 mg for two weeks  and now I'm taking 50 mg for two weeks (I'm on my 17th day) -- working my way up to 200 mg.  I don't know if I really like this medication.  It gives me headaches and affects my sleep.  I think it also increases my anxiety  but maybe that's in my head?  I suppose the side effects aren't ""terrible"" but I still feel somewhat drugged.  Has anyone else had success with Lamictal?  I really don't like being on medication at all and can't believe I'm going to end up taking 200 mg when right now I'm only taking 50 mg and feel as if I'm ""on"" something. ",1
 I just recently got a test back in one of my classes and saw that I totally failed it. Now I'm worried about this class and I can't afford to repeat anything  literally and figuratively. I'm older so I don't have the time to go screw around and repeat classes and I'm sick of school as it is. I hate the uphill battle  just barley hanging on. Why? I did great in high school with a 3.5 GPA. and I made straight A's a couple times in middle school. Other people breeze through school and it makes me angry that it's such a struggle for me just to get C's in college. I'm sick of this I want it all to end  and I still have a whole year after this semester. And even that's not a guarantee the way things are going. Just needed to rant.,1
 On Monday I plan to finally go and get help from a Doctor but I still haven't told anyone I know how I'm feeling. It's not because I don't want to it's just because I'm scared my parents won't take me seriously or think they have done something wrong bring me up. To tell you the truth I couldn't care what other people think of me but I'm just really worried what my family will think. I'm the oldest of 3 and when I was at school my dad pushed me hard to do well in studies and all that crap but now I'm older and have done nothing at all with my life I still don't know what to do with it. I was even at college for a year but quit after a year because I couldn't seam to keep up no matter what I did. Anyway I'm totally going off the point  I was just wondering if anyone would share with me how they managed to tell there parents? May sound stupid but this is just the hardest thing for me to do but I feel I really need to if I ever want to get over this!,1
 Hello  my name is Joe and I have been battling some form of depression  but I do not know what type or how severe it is. I have a family history of bipolar depression but I am not sure if this is a disease that is genetic to such an extent. Does it skip generations? My moods swing from euphoria to deep depression to where I contemplate just cutting away from my life and vanish. I am not suicidal; just feel at times isolation is the answer. I have one trigger I know of and it is usually when I am lacking in knowledge of a current situation I may be in. This make sense? Like tonight  I am out of town on business and working very late on some complex worksheets. I started getting depressed after the 12th hour of working and getting nowhere. This will then lead to insomnia and I will once again  for the second night in a row  be up all night working and mind wandering contemplating just getting in my car and driving to a remote town and re-invent myself. I have tried professional help  but to no avail I am just as bad if not worse. I figured since I am online most the day I would search for a forum that might lead me on a better path. After all shucking corn in Nebraska for room and board isn't such a great option the next morning. Well thank you for this opportunity to at least get this off my mind for at least tonight.,1
 I think I have insomnia and depression. I don't sleep at night. I stay up and think. I toss and turn. My mind races. And my life has gone nowhere. I'm in college and lately I just haven't been able to function. At first I thought it was laziness  but it's much more than that. I don't even feel like doing the things I used to. I don't feel like hanging out with my friends. I'm normally kind of introverted but it has definitely gotten worse lately. I have just wanted to be alone. All i've been doing is sleeping during the day .. just laying around ... zoning out ... I really haven't felt like doing anything at all. All I want is to crawl into a hole and sleep forever. I have so much to do schoolwork - wise and I just can't too it. I'm physically  emotionally  and mentally weak. I don't know what to do. I was told to talk to our school counselor but it's really hard for me to open up to new people  especially those I don't know. I don't think I could explain my problems to him. I don't know what to do. I can't just snap back into life ... I always end up here .. empty and depressed. Why??? What should I do?,1
 I think for me some of the major issues affecting my depression are happiness  motivation and isolation...I'm not really sure which came first  but I voted motivation  as I don't seem to have any! I can't remember the last time I truly felt 'happy' either - I think it was probably about 5 or 6 years ago when I was in college  had a great social life and thought I was with a great guy :-/ Socially  I find it very difficult to stay in touch with people because I'm paranoid that they don't really want to hear from me. I lost touch with friends when I moved to college  and then lost friends when I moved back to my home town. Now I have very few friends  and feel the ones I do have don't really care too much about me. I hate sounding like I'm feeling sorry for myself  but it's hard to explain...,1
 I'm a guy...well still a teen but a guy  and the sad thing is I feel such like a girl. I'm not into the macho thing  but I cry all the time when I'm not around people  I feel like crap  I have swings where all of a sudden I just get very very angry at people All these things. I've never gone to a doctor out of fear of embarrassment and telling my parents what I feel. I hide it from them and try to hide it from others...but it usually doesn't work. Its been like this for a year now  but as of late it doesn't end  before there was some couple of day breaks in between  but now everyday I am depressed. I am sick of life...I want to end it  but the only thing that is stopping me is what happens if I do. I just can't get pass the action....what happens during it. There is almost a physical feeling surrounding me...I feel it. That is just how I feel. Hope that gives insight. Maybe its the man in me to scared to go to a doctor.,1
" Lately i have been having some very vivid story - like dreams  normally i can't follow my dreams because they switch too quickly. i had a dream where i took my grandmother's large knife and a permanent marker and wrote my signature on it. Then later my mother found out about what i had done and became so angry with what i had done  that she made me cry  and i actually woke up crying. Then later that day i took a nap and i dreamt that i was being seduced by Tom Cruise  (who had gained a lot of weight)  and when things began to heat up i rejected him  and he became very angry at me. He then later came to the house where i was  and began trying to hurt me and the people around me (which was an older lady  a young boy and teenage girl). i could hear him saying ""just kill them"" and talking about how he was really embarrassed when i rejected him  and he could do so much better than me. i then proceeded to take the young boy into hiding  and while hiding we were found and the boy hurt Tom defensively  but in a very graphic manor. I can't understand why i'm having such negative dreams  why they are so vivid  and what they all mean!",1
 I'm 16 years old. I am having problems in school and I feel like dropping out. I also feel like committing suicide. I have foster parents and I don't like them one bit. I cry every night because I miss my mom. At this point in life I don't feel a need in living. I really need your help and advice to make me feel more comfortable talking to my foster parents and to convince me not to kill myself. I am a very suicidal person who is looking for help. I have a record of cutting myself and burning myself so i think that the cutting and burning led to suicidal attempts I am looking for help. i don't know what led suicide but if anyone has any advice on what i could do or any questions please tell me,1
" (I am 39) I say this to myself all the time  SJW...I never thought I would be in this position....but I am...and so are you...I can relate to you on many levels. If I did not work for my father I am sure I would be unemployed...due to my concentration problems  ATTENDANCE problems  uneven mood and unpredictable production level...so I am very lucky. I can see what challenges you face. I often thought that I might like to go into some sort of counseling because of my life experiences also. Do you live in a big enough city that you can apply at some mental health clinics or government aid departments? Sometimes the willingness to do that kind of work can get you in the door. It may be entry level  but you could work up if it were a job that satisfied your needs. What about like an activity director at a youth home  or a retirement village/senior home  or a special needs program? Here our recreation commission has a special populations program that coordinates trips and activities for the special population of the area. They go on ski trips and day trips and it looks very fun! Of course it takes a certain frame of mind to be able to work with the special population of the world. But I just mention it because you talked about counseling... I just wanted to clarify that although I am very lucky to have an income  it really fuels my depression sometimes to think about ""how I am letting my dad down"" or causing him extra crap to deal with...so lucky and not so lucky.",1
 I went on 6weeks. FMLA almost two years ago for depression  GAD and Panic Disorder. I felt uncomfortable when I went back  after having had the same position for 25 yrs  but I'm still there  and no one made a big deal about it when I came back. I'm still on medicines for depression and have a ton of anxiety  which the medicines help with. I'm able to function in a fast paced environment where things change every day. I can sleep  which is great as I put off going in for treatment and was beat when I finally got on medicines  had lost weight  and was headed for agoraphobia. Medicines and some therapy work well for me. I can't deny that I had myself under one ton of stress and had no outlets. I found out the hard way that there's more to life than work  work  work. One has to find a way to relax  too.,1
 Hey  My name is Jonathan. I'm 23 years old. I'm a senior in college hoping to be through very VERY soon. I went through a really rough depression era starting around the age of 15 and lasting till I was 21. It started to get a little better when I got into college  but then severely accelerated throughout the years. I took a year off from school to work and basically to get help  which I did. I found out a lot of my depression was cognitive... thinking negatively about myself. When I was growing up  I was a real shy guy. I think some of that though has turned into a social anxiety issue  but I didn't have a great social. I still don't  but once I got help  the psychologist I saw really helped me get past the negative thinking  but I still have really tightly bound emotional issues from time to time that tend to really upset me. It's taken pieces of my personality and completely do a 180. Part of my depression was that I was co-dependent. Now I'm really completely independent. I guess I'm trying more to understand than to get just advice. I can't make sense of my emotions anymore.,1
 The only thing that can happen in such a boring world is terror. Or something. Did you se the footage from Monrovia (that's in Liberia  for any Americans who might be reading this...)? I can't understand how these kids are just walking around firing their AKs as if they are hanging out after school. You don't tend to see the other side but I assume it's the same. There was a shot of a group of kids nonchalantly lounging around on the back of a pickup truck upon which was mounted an old-fashioned looking heavy machine-gun  the kind with an armored shield and mounted on a pivot  maybe a mobile anti-aircraft gun. The truck wasn't moving  the gun was in use. So why were a bunch of kids just sitting there? Don't human beings usually seek to protect themselves from danger? Why do people involved in a fire fight walk around as if they were popping out to the shops for a six pack and a box of 200 B & H? Despite 3 weeks service in the Israeli army  I have yet to experience any sort of hostile activity which goes beyond the emotional... What do you do when everything you were told turned out to be bullshit and you realize that everyone you know is deluded? I have started to experience intense rages which appear to be provoked by my girlfriend  who  it seems  thinks that the purpose of a relationship is to psychoanalyze one's partner destructively  to the point of inducing a breakdown. Or something. I have lashed out at her  hitting and screaming and have  during intense screaming matches  to beat my fists against the wall. This is the best I can do to prevent myself from smashing her to pieces. My right hand still hurts me from a couple of days ago. She closes the windows to try to spare the neighbors any unpleasantness. God knows what they must think. Like I could give a fuck. I am inconsiderate  I am selfish  I am a bastard  I have a cold attitude to others  I am a snob  I have contempt for everyone. I don't know which is my stuff and which is hers. I am thinking more of suicide these days. I used to have the regular teenage fascination with my mortality and the potential termination thereof. We were going to try for a baby but she has a hormonal condition which seems quite serious. I have to go wank in a jar and see if my tadpoles are doing whatever it is they should do. She wants me to consider going off with another woman to procreate if it turns out she is infertile. This fills me with rage. I will not tell you why. If you don't understand this you don't understand. What does anyone understand? Is life ever going to change? I am starting to suffer from a new sort of depression. I am starting to feel like I am 31 and the old passion is really not there anymore. Everything is hopeless but it can't ever change. I want to hurt myself and have a fantasy to kill myself with my Leatherman. AHAHAHAHAHA.,1
" I'm 15 and have been depressed for about a year. i got over it for a little while but now i am back to all the pain. I cut myself for the first time a couple weeks ago and now i can't stop. I always reach for my knife when I'm alone and hurting.  One of my major problems is that I'm really good at hiding my feelings. No one knows that I'm depressed and no one except my best friend knew that i cut myself. I told my best friend because we tell each other everything when I told her the only thing she could say was ""you're Crazy"" Not exactly the reaction i was expecting especially since she once told me that she cut herself because we got into a huge fight. And even though I knew she was only saying it for attention and she had no scars on her wrist the next day  i still supported her. But now she is turning her back on me. I think she thinks I'm doing it for attention but I'm not. if i were i wouldn't hide the scars under my wrist band and long sleeve shirts. Any way so now i have no one there to talk to. I don't trust anyone anymore and I'm too scared to tell my parents. Even if i did they can't do anything. I have 3 other brothers and my parents don't have the time or money to deal with my problems.  I really scare myself. I have already planned out how I'm going to kill myself if i do and i tempt myself all the time i never have the guts to go through with it all the way but I still try.  I just really need some one to talk to. Someone who will understand where I'm coming from. ",1
 I've realized that I made a big mistake by starting this blog. It serves no purpose to put feelings out for public view  so I've deleted the entries from the last six months. I was going to explain some things  but thought better of it. I think a small part of my old self has awakened again. I'm a bit ashamed of all the whining I've done here. I'm embarrassed that I've sought out people in my life for emotional support when I should have dealt with things privately  on my own. When I lost my mind to grief  I forgot everything that I knew. As the old adage goes: you come into this world alone  you live alone  you die alone. You solve your problems alone  needs to be added. The intense pain of grief can warp your mind  impair your judgment and make you do foolish things that you will later regret. I'm sorry if I've upset anyone  but my intention was simply an attempt at self-help  not to change the world. I was simply searching for a way to try to deal with and escape from this pain. I've always appreciated the supportive comments left by people and I thought I had expressed that before. I never thought anyone had an expectation that I would contact them or would even really want me to contact them. I am after all  a stranger to those who have read my words. I was getting to the point where I was starting to  consider emailing some of the people who have posted comments  just to thank them  but now I think that it's better that I don't. This is the old  public version of me writing to day.  I've pushed most of the real  troubled me back down into a box for a little while. I've resolved only to let her out when I'm alone. In this blog  I did dwell on many of the same things again and again  but I was surprised that I could actually find some release by repeatedly talking about the same thing. I think this will be my last entry  so goodbye and good luck.,1
 No doubt in my mind that since I have been taking Zoloft   I do dream a  lot more and sometimes very vividly.  Most of mine don't make any sense either ... but on occasion  my remembered dreams are so real   it's almost spooky.  (If only those dreams were somewhat romantic  well then I wouldn't be bringing this up  would I? ... lol)  Another thing I noticed is that if I'm asleep and my cell phone rings  I get up  walk a few feet away   answer  carry a short conversation and afterwards  I have no recollection whatsoever.  It reminds me of sleep walking.  That is so unusual and strange to me.  You are not alone xxx :-)  and I am so glad you're feeling much better!   ,1
 I am  61 and for almost two years have been dealing with anxiety. It is strange the way of hitting and I would like to know from some of you experts if it is typical GAD.  For almost two years I have been awakened almost every day at about 5:30 out of sound sleep with this feeling of anxiety. At first it hit my spine  now my stomach. If I take a xanax it will dissipate and not bother me much until later in the day. Again  no matter what I am doing I can feel it start to build  take a xanax and go on with life. By late afternoon it is gone and doesn't return until the next day.  During this period my thyroid has been going haywire  probably from four surgeries in four years  the last being two months ago...a total knee repacement.. About sox weels before this surgery  after changing my thyroid meds a bit  the anxiety had left me. I was fine through the operation and then about three weeks after  it was back!  Before the operation I was beginning to get some real bouts of rolling depression but they are gone for now ... just anxiety. The thing that I question is that it is the same no matter what is or has happened in my life for the day. I can have a great  relaxed day or a hectic  chaotic day and the next day will be exactly the same. My environment doesn't seem to affect it. Is all of this typical of GAD or should I redress my thyroid or other hormonal screw ups? Thanks for reading. It's really getting me down! ,1
 I'm new and my message doesn't seem to fit anywhere else. I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 (now 21) but I've only recently thought of it as 'depression' as I used to think it was just me and all my feelings were real. It started with wanting to end up in hospital - get hit by a car etc. I felt useless and boring and unwanted by my family or anyone. Felt like I was jus in the way wherever I went. I felt empty and the only escape I ever had was fantasizing about the day I die - that release that I would feel from everything. So I used to write suicide notes and when I could read them without crying then I would deem myself ready. Or I would think that if I could starve myself for a week then I would be ready. (This one I couldn't do) finally it all got too much. In my head  my parents were so disappointed in me that they would be better off without me and to my sisters I was too annoying that they wouldn't miss me. Up until now I had jus cut myself discreetly. So I took 80 paracetamol (not knowing then that they can't actually kill you) and jus sat around waiting - half excited half scared. Nothing happened for ages and I started to get more scared - what would my parents think? Would they cope? Would they blame themselves? So I threw up and called an ambulance myself. I will never get over how hurt they were by what I had done and so will never do that again. But I still think bout it. When ever things get too hard. I think how can I make it look like an accident as I know they could handle that much better than suicide. I have been on antidepressants for 8 months now. For the 3rd time. But it seems that they are just putting a 'blanket' over how I'm feeling and I'm not addressing the real issues; not that I know what they are. I can't get motivated to study  go to class  go out  anything. I don't care. I don't see the point in living a miserable life and what if there is no point? what if our worlds are all the creation of our minds and once our minds are dead  so is our world so there's no one left hurting once were gone? What is the point to a miserable life when it could all be ended now? I don't think suicide is the right way to go - I believe only god  whatever you conceive him to be (if anything) should have the only power over life and death  but why does he take some people and not others? (More specifically  me?) I pray that he will take me next - give me the cancer meant for someone who loves life - but as yet has been to no avail. But if all we are to do is to be alive then die  why can I not decide to take my death into my own hands  like so many people do what they want with their lives? Of course  there's always the factor of limbo - do people who commit suicide really end up in limbo? I suppose what scares me even more is that - going through the pain and anguish of suicide just to end up in limbo - with just your mind  thinking away for ever.... are my feelings wrong? Is it a chemical reaction in my brain? Or do I just not belong in this life? So confused! And just don't see the point in being here - anyone have the answers I'm looking for? Life is pointless.,1
 I am 17 and am going through some really hard times. My close friend died in a car accident last may  I am going through relationship problems  my body isn't fighting disease off very well  I am looking for where i belong in life / school  I was sexually abused by my boss and have a trial coming up the first of march  I have classes like physics and calculus to look forward to  my father and i haven't gotten along very well which is really hard because we were very close  my mother is pushing me very hard especially since i have interests in becoming a doctor  my job barely pays for my gas  my school told me i would be able to attend a seminar in Wisconsin and recently told me somebody else got to go instead  my friends are few and of lately not very true  and sadly that is the start of it ... i was hoping that i would be able to find somebody that could lend an ear since i have trouble finding anybody that cares much here.  i need a friend ...,1
 I'm 19 and I'm severely depressed.  I am at my wits end and i don't know what to do any more.  I feel empty inside and the only way I feel something is when I cut myself.  I don't care what feeling comes out  whether it's pain  adrenaline  or guilt ...  I don't care what feeling  but I need to feel something.  I keep thinking that death will be a sweet surrender and I use to be scared to do it but now I'm not so sure anymore ...  I keep thinking how blissful it would be to finally set myself free  to let my pain and suffering disintegrate along with my soul.  Every time I think of this  I smile ... and it scares me.  I smile at the thought of death.   I don't how to stop and I feel as if there is no end to this misery.  I stopped talking to therapists  psychologists  counselors  etc.  There is no hope. ,1
" I'm new to the forum and this is the most interesting thread I've found so far. I'm in my mid fifties and have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember. It's got a lot worse lately. I've been an ""underachiever"" because of it  but now I've slowly lost just about everything. I've been on Prozac  Effexor  etc.  and I'm now on Zispin. This latest one makes me sleep a lot. I couldn't get up for work even if I could hold down a job. I've gone from being a successful business man to losing wife  estranging my kids and grand kids  I'm unemployed  out of money and running out of hope. It's time that depression in men was seen as the problem it really is. How many of us are performing so far below what we are intellectually  physically and emotionally capable of? It's not just a personal problem. It's a problem for our families and friends and I believe it robs our society of a lot of valuable people. Here's hoping that there really is a solution out there somewhere.",1
" I wasn't going to do it  I really wasn't. I was off in my own little happy medicine head world  but he had to go and ruin it for me.

 Hi folks  I've only discovered this topic after making several previous posts :) I am from a traditional Asian culture  but now half-westernized on migration to Australia since age 6. I've had a long history that stems right to my parents' histories before I was born. To cut it very short  my father has schizoid/schizotypal/socially withdrawn personality traits  and my mother has dependent traits  so they basically had a loveless marriage (common in my culture). There is a long history of parental quarrelling and physical abuse on my mother before and after I was born  some of which I heard as a child to early teens. I was seldom exposed socially growing up  and I had few school friends. I was also 'born' a quiet person  but this and lack of socializing made me a withdrawn kid. When I was about 4  I believe I experienced one psychotic episode (I 'saw' 2 caped 'grim reapers' at that time)  since which I have no further experiences. I experienced a few bouts of depression during secondary school  for which I didn't seek help because of my shyness and parental/cultural stigma that 'depression does not exist' (thankfully my family has ditched that attitude now). During that time  I had many suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide maybe 3 times but didn't tell anyone about it. A very terrible incident also happened towards the end of high school - one night  I physically assaulted my father while he was quarrelling with mom  and he was hospitalized. I got charged with assault  but no conviction was recorded after I did psychotherapy for anger control - that was also the only therapeutic contact with psychological/psychiatric services I had until very recently. That incident  although I felt numb through that time  has been scarred into my memory - I can still recall the events  and my conscience is still wrecked over it  though I continue to fight it and let it go. At school  I was a top-end academic achiever in science and math. I was named dux of the school on graduation. Upon entering university  my depression became worse mainly because of increased social isolation. I was still shy and withdrawn  I lost contact with my high school friends (they also saw me as 'weird'  but I was also a bit narcissistic towards them at some times - I think it was an unconscious aggressive reaction towards them)  and failed to make any lasting friendship with university peers. One year into university  I started studying Medicine  which I am still doing at the moment. However I felt that course had over time did not improve me  though I did make few friends. I still felt unable to socialize with peers  even though I was in constant contact with them through many lectures and tutorials. Even though I was an average performer  I felt I struggled heavily through the years with study. Late last year  my depression hit a new low - my parents had another quarrel  and I was studying psychiatry which forced me to realize the extensiveness of my past and current problems. It was another awful time - I lost a lot of self-confidence/esteem  became more withdrawn. I ended up failing my first practical exam but still passed given my past satisfactory academic record - the faculty put it down to lack of practice  but the truth is because of what I experienced leading up to the exam. In this year however my depressive bouts became much worse - my few friends had deferred  and I was left with no friends  despite still knowing the others 'by name'. My experience during this year was largely negative - I felt harassed by teaching doctors  peers  being looked at as a 'weirdo' and excluded from conversations and their social outings (whether this was a valid view  I'm finding out now by resocializing with them - my main aim at the moment). Over the last 2 months I had about 5 more depressive episodes  and attempted suicide 3 times  again nobody knew about them. It became a frantic situation - I approached the faculty dean for help  but he only recommended me a psychiatrist  who he was supposed to contact before I contacted him. However that psychiatrist wasn't notified  and I felt very angry about it and thought that nobody was out there to help me. In retrospect  my view was unrealistic - help only exists on a professional level  something I knew long before but did not acknowledge at that time  making me upset. My depression faded away a few days later. A few nights ago  I had a short dispute with mom  got upset and this eventually led to me joining this forum after a quick search on the net. Why am I writing this intro? Several reasons. I want to tell my story to others  and feel this is a stepping stone to encourage myself. I also want others not yet aware that depression can affect ANYONE  even the best of us  even those involved in the medical profession (up to 30% of junior doctors suffer from depression  and up to 10% have attempted/committed suicide). I want to improve my own situation - most of all  learning to deal with feelings of sadness and negatively that has crippled me mentally in the past  and my lack of sociability which doesn't help my situation. I know deep inside I am capable of pulling through  of being able to live a normal healthy life because I am aware of my problems and have the power to deal with them. Finally  although I'm still a student  I believe my position is privileged and that I should use what knowledge I have learnt to help others as best as I can  something I will be bound to by Hippocratic Oath on finishing school. I am grateful that such a forum exists for others and me to express our thoughts  experiences and feelings  and that there are people out there who devote themselves for such causes. Thank you all.,1
 i have suffered from depression for a long time and used to self harm while i was at school.  things seemed to be getting better  i got a job  boyfriend and was a lot happier.  but lately I've just got fired  me and my boyfriend are splitting up  i lost 3 of my pet rats in a short period of time.  everything is going downhill and i can't seem to stop it. I've been thinking more and more about self harm again. i can't help it. i just can't take it all anymore.     i guess i just had to tell someone. someone who will understand and not be judgmental and just say  don't do that again  as it isn't as easy as that as I'm sure you all know.    ETA: i haven't cut for a few years. but the temptation is too much at the moment. ,1
" Could anyone help me.!  First my doctor gave me Wellbutrin SR ... well it made me too panicky .. This was 150 SR.  So then he gave me Wellbutrin XL at 150 mg.  This was doing well but not quite enough so he gave me 300 XL and I was so sleepy I could not handle it.  I don't know why it made me so sleepy but I only stayed on it a few days and then I went back to the doctor and he said ""ok let's go back to the SR pills but at 100 mg.  Well I'm still have those nervous feelings.  It's like I get hot  I get antsy and dizzy headed.  I'm guessing the SR is dispensed faster or something?

" it don't get no better than this Last night was a success. I was in truly rare form. My last non-fuzzy memory is of chugging beers at a friend's around 10:30  but highlights of the night include: making out with two of my girl friends; flashing one of my more reserved friends (reaction: ""Did she just flash me??""); waking up this morning with a stranger's cell phone on my desk (a peek through the phone book  and I was pretty sure he's not a law student)  but thankfully no owner of the cell phone in my bed; doing way too many shots when  after being asked if I wanted to do shots  I responded  ""I really shouldn't do whiskey shots... Bring me the tequila!"" and apparently a solid effort at drunk dialing  if the outgoing call log on my cell is any indication. We had a really fun night  but then getting shitty with friends is always a good time. I think I was still drunk when I went to Civ Pro this morning  hmm. The bar we went to is dead on Thursday nights (though really packed on Friday and Saturday nights). It was nice  though -- we had the bar to ourselves. About 40 people showed up  and after talking to us for awhile  the owner said he'd give us drink specials on Thursday nights if we came back. He even comped a lot of our drinks  which was cool. We'll definitely be back. I liked this place already  but this is true incentive. A couple people are out tonight  but I lost my steam after Happy Hour. I just felt too exhausted to even think about going out. I made macaroni & cheese  sat on the couch  and watched TV. It's been a nice  quiet night.",1
 I myself have suffered Major Depression Disorder for years. I myself got diagnosed in the last year and half with Major Depressive Disorder  Recurrent  Moderate  Severity; Disorder of Written Expression; Reading Disorder; and even Asperger's Disorder. I was diagnosed in 2004. The Doctor and I did many tests. When I got My diagnosed with depression by the doctor I Myself was not surprise by the diagnoses. Though we did not to what I remember did not talk about depression. I knew I have been suffering depression for years that even I could diagnose myself. I myself have been trying to get help for myself for the last five years. I have been on various drugs like Paxil which had made me suicidal in 2000. I got off it though before I did commit suicide I thank God for that. My depression has always made me suicidal at one time or another. Living with depression has made me do things like drinking and such things like that in My Life. With My Depression in My Life has lead Me to find Myself in ways that I am learning from My Depression. I have a cousin that committed suicide 2005 His Life will be missed I know for Myself for He also suffered a Major Depressive Disorder. I sometimes just feel like giving up Myself but have yet found something so I will not give up in the end. I hope I still yet learn something that I do not every give up. I have done this for many years with out any doctors or drugs to help Me. Sometimes I wonder why I am still here living on this Earth. It sometimes has been very hard for Me just like My cousin. I will leave it there,1
" I've basically been living a lie for the last year.  My depression / social anxiety has become so crippling that I'm scared to work outside of the home  but I told my parents that I was working anyway  because I didn't want them to know how bad it was.  I wasn't taking money from them or anything (I don't live with my parents  and my husband has a great job and I don't technically HAVE to work)  but now that I've come clean about it my mother says she feels ""manipulated.""  I guess I can see why  and I do feel really bad about lying to them.  I suppose that their forgiveness will just take time.  But the thing is  I can't tell any of them HOW BAD THIS REALLY IS  including my husband.  It's to the point now where I'm even afraid to see a doctor.  I'm sure there isn't some magic formula for getting past actually having to admit that you have a really serious problem   but I was just wondering how some of you were able to get past that feeling of embarrassment and shame that keeps you from getting help  and telling the people you love the truth.   Every day is getting harder and harder  especially now that my family knows I've been lying.  I really thought telling them would make everything a little easier (lying = instant paranoia!)  but now I can't stop thinking about how I've ruined my relationships with them forever  and I'm even more hopeless than I was before.  How can I get past this embarrassment?     ",1
" I have just now realized now  after 24+ years of experiencing it  that what I've suffered from is depression. Soon after that  I spoke to my dad about it  and learned he'd been on AD's for over 10 years now  and he said he probably could have used them from the time he was about 15 years old on. He also said my paternal grandmother's side of the family was all just like us (my dad and I are almost carbon copies of each other  except he's always seemed much more ""perfect"" to me than I am.  ) He also said my oldest half brother is also on AD's. I also talked to my oldest daughter (who's 21 year-old)  and she said she's been on AD's a few times too. I can say also that I learned many years after his death that my maternal grandfather experienced severe depression before I was born. He had shock therapy multiple times it seems...but I don't know if his problems were entirely from the extreme horrors he experienced in WWII  or a combination of that plus other problems. When I knew him he was always a sweet loving  rather quiet  man (and my favorite person in the world other than my dad.) My dad said he never associated my problems with depression (of course  neither did I)  but now it all clicks. I wish I'd known all this when I was younger  that depression hadn't had the stigma it had back in the 1970s & 80s  and that I could have gotten treatment back then. Of course  if I had  I wouldn't have the same life I have now  so I guess I can't complain about that (and honestly wouldn't change a thing...I wouldn't risk losing my kids or what I've accomplished  no matter how crooked and difficult the path as been). But I will definitely watch my young kids now for signs of depression (especially my 4 year-old daughter  since she seems to have a similar personality to my dad and I). If I see it  they will get the treatment they need immediately! So in that sense I think this is a blessing...knowledge is power.",1
 I posted here sometime in December I think. I was having tons of digestive problems  well it's been about 4 months now and I'm still having them  but now I also feel extremely fatigued all the time too  I've had test after test and seen doctor after doctor  everything comes back negative. I was actually put on Zoloft for about a month but taken off of it to try other things b/c that wasn't doing the trick either. I'm back to thinking that it's all in my head  I'm now on b12 shots but those aren't doing anything either. I feel like a zombie  I have zero energy and zero motivation to do anything. Even the simplest task like styling my hair seems like a huge chore that I just want to put off. All I want to do is sleep all day. One thing I've noticed is that man do I ever waste time  I mean I literally do nothing but waste time most of the day. I only have about two hours of class per day and no job so I have tons of free time to waste away. I analyzed what I did in the past hour and it basically went like this: The entire time I was talking to myself non-stop  analyzing things  analyzing my situation  thinking of motivational quotes etc.... I tend to do that all day. For about 15 minutes I stood around leaning against a wall  the next 15 minutes i leaned against the television  then I went and lied down for a while all while still thinking and analyzing things in my head  then I came on the computer to just look at random  pointless things. And that is pretty much how most of my time is spent  I might spend an hour or so just standing around or sitting doing nothing but thinking or daydreaming  that can't possibly be healthy and I obviously have way too much free time  I'm just not sure if this is what is in turn causing all my fatigue and sickness. Have I become so addicted to this lifestyle that my mind will purposely make me feel sick so I have an excuse to live like this?,1
 I'm a 30 year old  married  stay at home mom to 4 kids.  I was diagnosed with depression about 2 years ago after some MAJOR problems in my marriage.  Although I've been in and out of depression for the last 14 years.  I was put on Prozac  took that for 2 years and made the mistake of taking myself off it.  So  I'm right back where I started from.  I think for me a lot of it is .... my life should have been so much different.  I shouldn't have gotten married at 19 (even though I love him)  should have finished college  etc .... there are so many should haves you know?  I've been suicidal ... though not for a long time.  I know there are things I need to do for my kids and my family  but many days I just can't bring myself to do them.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME???  Even though I know the answer I ask the question every day.  Why can't I be normal?  Why can't I just be a wife and a mother and have that be enough?   I wish everyone well in this terrifying journey we all have to endure. ,1
 I've been neglecting you my wonderful little blog haven't I? I'm sorry... I didn't mean to. Last night Carmen was a giggle  and so was the Anakali. I'm glad I didn't go into the Blue Rock. Even in my drunken state I realized it was a bad idea. I'm glad Gem did her job (Go gem!) and I did mine by not going to the Blue Rock after  and taking her home with me so Life is good. ish. Yet again  I am surprised by lack of hangover  but I'm not complaining. The day I get a hangover will be the day cows start flying... hopefully... I shall be quiet now. I have hockey to go to. Tech to do. Violin to practice. Awakenings to happen. You get the idea.... Love you!!,1
 I went to Lauren's place last night with Lee and watched Takashi Miike's Audition with them and Loro's boyfriend Thomas. It was great. Especially for a Friday the 13th. I can't wait to see Ichi the Killer with them. Oh  and Visitor Q! I don't think I've ever known anyone who can sit through his movies and enjoy them with me  rather than be grossed out and run away. Hah! Yay! Hurray for sick fuckers! I panicked at work just before 5:00pm on Friday and ended up calling my doctor to schedule an appointment so that I could get back onto my medication. I thought I would be fine without it. After all  it's been about a month now. My eyes water at the mere mentioning of something upsetting and I've been getting frustrated really easily. Whether I like it or not  I'm going to need to stay on it. Hopefully not forever. I just started to become really worried because orientation for Chili's has begun and this coming two weeks are going to be full-on training. I can't afford to lose it since I already gave my notice in at the shop. I went on a shopping spree at work to get a few things I've had my eye on so that I could still get a discount. Is that bad? Meh.,1
" I have so much to say and don't know where to start......  Let's see I am in a relationship with a man who is not the same guy I met before he was so caring and always wanted to give me affection. Now all he can seem to do is drink and constantly want to fight. He has become to the point where everything I do is monitored he checks my cell phone to see who has called  checks my EMails to see who wrote  calls me 2 - 3 a day to see what I am doing  won't ""allow"" me to go over to my friend's house  who I have known for almost 20 years  without him being there  and checks the history on the computer to see what web sites I visited. Now I have NEVER cheated on him  and I always find wrong in what he is doing. Some days I just wish he would leave  but other days all I  seem to hope is that  he will change. Every one of my friends thinks that he should go since he is getting physical  but he is my security. I don't work and I can stay home with my 7 month old baby he provides for us  and the baby isn't his. If he goes how do I do it ? If he stays will he change? I have tried to talk to him  but all he says is that I am never happy. I need to grow up and stop acting like a kid .... I want to smile again I don't want to be controlled  but I want him?  Someone please HELP !!!!!!!!  I do ask  MOM for a lot of help  but I don't think that is too kid like........  I can be a B word  but only if I am mad about something he won't help me on ........ I want a day to myself  a night to go out with friends  but he won't watch my son. Even though I watch his 3 year old every day 7 days a week so that he can provide for our family ....  Sorry I could go on forever  but I think that you get the point ....... By the way I am a 25 year old in case you are wondering????  Will you help me PLEASE !!!!! ",1
 I willingly admit that I am a sufferer of depression. But in my case  I think the problem was education more than anything. I recognize that I have been depressed pretty much from as far back as I can remember. I'm not sure where I got the misinformation but I spent most of my life believing that it was just me  just life  you know  the thinking that some people were lucky and happy and I just wasn't. I'm 34 now so it is a wonder that I made it to this point  considering the statistics. I think that I tried to destroy myself in other ways like smoking and minor drugs and not taking care of myself. Basically I was waiting for things to either get better or finish falling apart. About a year ago  my new doctor recognized the symptoms in me and offered me help in the form of Zoloft and some counseling which changed my life. The problem then became that I changed jobs and lost my insurance with no hope of COBRA so I actually went of the drug cold turkey (highly not recommended  believe me) and am now back where I started. Have any of you found yourselves in this situation? What do you do?,1
" Hello  I'm new here. I'm 36 and have had depression since the age of 9. I'm supposed to take Lexapro every day  but often I forget. Memory / concentration is poor  one of the areas of the brain that depression screws with  the others being sleep  appetite  and libido.  Here's my thing ... I'm so gosh darn afraid to do anything! It's hard at times to even face my job  I call in sick and stay in pajamas all day. I do get out of bed  but I won't bathe or brush teeth. Isn't that gross! I did this on Monday and Tuesday this week.  I'm in school at night  it's a tele course class in geology. Last Friday we had an exam  and I didn't show up for it because I didn't do any reading for it. Now it's almost Wednesday  and I still haven't touched the reading. We can make up the exam no later than 1 week after the exam date  so I have two days to cover several chapters. Thing is  I'm SCARED CRAPLESS to even start!!! It's like I've got ""freeze - itis"" and I can't seem to study! I've been doing other things  like cleaning and laundry and doing Immigration research (trying to bring my Egyptian fiance here to the States)  but haven't touched the geology  even though that's been #1 on my mind for two weeks. Even this past weekend  I had no plans (as usual!) and didn't crack open even one page.  I fear failure  and it's so hard to ""let go and let God"". I know in my head to give this fear to God  but I don't really know what that specifically means. In the meantime  I'm miserable and failing my geology class. Already I dropped the music class (originally I had two)  since I was failing that royally.  Can anyone relate? How do any of you summon up the courage to face your fears? ",1
 I have just joined up because recently things have become a little too hard to cope with alone. I have suffered with depression for as long as i can remember really. but it's hard to find people who I can talk to. I always end up feeling like a burden  i know my friends just want me to be my happy party girl self  not the unhappy honest self. so I tend to keep quiet. Would love to have people to talk to about how i feel. I also have two little boys who I have to keep a happy face on for. find it hard to keep it up.,1
 Hello all. My name is Daniel I'm 23 and going to school in Bowling Green  Ohio. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder  ADD  and depression. I've tried various medicines for my ADD and the last one I was on was Effexor XR  usually used to treat depression but can be used for adult ADD  I was on it for a year or two and kept increasing the dosage b/c I wasn't seeing enough results. The medicine dosage got too high and I had a break down during the summer of 05. To vent I would cut myself and eventually attempted suicide in a Kroger parking lot. I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed medicines  but I've grown tired of using medicines; I had a seizure while on a drug for acne. I refused to take the medicines and have been struggling with killing myself every day. I don't really like going into public due to my social anxiety and tend to turn to computer games to escape reality. I drink more caffeine than is healthy  don't sleep at night  and have fluctuations in eating. I never think I am good at anything  I built a computer last night which kind of made me feel good about myself  but that's not enough. I've stopped going to class because I don't think I'm good enough and haven't told anyone. I'm pretty much a wreck right now and am in the process of going to the counseling center that my school offers. I don't know how much longer I can hold out before I try something else. I am struggling to even be happy around my friends  family and girl friend. They all know I think about it every day  but never say anything. It's probably because I hide my feelings and lie to them about it. I don't want to even keep going to school it feels so pointless. My girl friend wants to get married I don't even want to think about it. I don't want to get married and am too gutless to tell her. I have feelings of breaking up with her but once again I'm to scared and gutless to say anything. I hate myself.,1
 What a great topic!! The news always makes me cry - and I end up turning it off shortly after I start watching it - why do I punish myself? My parents know that I have learned to not watch the news because of the negative effect it has on me  so if something really important is going on  they let me know. My Aunt suffers from chronic depression and delusion  and I've had numerous conversations with her on how to handle the depression because she's tried so many different things  even going to Mexico to see a Shaman. Her top 3 suggestions (and I really go by them as much as I possibly can) are: 1) Get proper sleep - this is probably the most paramount point; 2) get proper nutrition; and 3) don't watch the news. The one thing that I absolutely cannot tolerate is sad news about animals - that really sends me. When I'm flipping thru channels and happen upon Animal Planet and the Animal Police are busting people because of their cruelty - I have to turn it immediately. I think I'm delusional too in that I choose not to watch the news  animal stories  anything really unpleasant - I guess I try to live in my little world without negativity or sadness. I know that it isn't very mature or adult  but this is my coping mechanism. I do find that when I hear or see anything sad or awful that my negativity really gets into gear  and then I'm completely negative for awhile. Driving is also incredibly difficult because I commute into Washington D.C. from the suburbs and traffic is awful. I become so negative about the other drivers around me that I end up hating myself over my thoughts about them! They  of course  drive too slow and are idiots. I need to find a job close to home! I too have sometimes felt that the human race needs to think about not populating the world anymore. I wouldn't want to raise a small child in this environment any more! I'm glad my son is in college and he's the only one that I could have. But then again  I can't wait until my sister or brother has kids so that I can be with them and spoil them rotten. Crazy isn't it? I have taken others suggestions in this thread and have tried to make myself think positively the last 2 days. It's difficult but possible! I notice that my mood has brightened somewhat too. Thanks to you all for this thread  as I think it really can help!,1
 i know you wouldn't have guessed it by my name i am 18 i have recently become a paraplegic (paralyzed from the chest down) this is down to unbelievable circumstances misdiagnosed several times  misreading of  results and MRI scans i was in a relationship before the injury for 3 years with a lad similar age. i did sport and exercise science at college and was a well known sports person for several different sports. As well as losing the use of my legs and other bodily functions  my boyfriend cheated on me whilst seriously ill i now feel highly vulnerable and lost as my whole life as i once new it has been taken away not only this but my mom within in herself has so much to cope with as well as watching the pain i go through i nearly died 4 times including boxing day and christmas day. i am lucky in the fact i have plenty of friends and family which support me the only problem is no one understands i have always been very strong minded and kept my chin up and  a smile recently as my 18th birthday has just passed i have realized what i have lost  and how i have 2 sit and watch all my friends getting on with life the doctor is always advising me to take my tablets and antidepressants but i choose not to. Although by reading this you will not be able to see how much i have to deal with. i feel as though i am becoming a burden to my family and i really feel i need someone unrelated to my social surroundings to give me a small nudge back to feeling more like myself. i have always had boyfriends before my injury but now it is impossible for me to see myself with anybody again. Due to the fact using the unfortunate words i am now a wheelchair user. can someone please help me.,1
" I am in a state of emptiness. Recently  I was in a relationship with someone who didn't love me  but I loved them intensely. I had hoped eventually she would turn around  but for that time  I found deep meaning in her. Now it's over  and she doesn't seem to care. Meanwhile  I am in hell. It's like the past four years of my life were just a dream. I feel humiliated  used and defeated. I feel like I have nothing. I lost my job  stopped going to school  and was forced to move back in with my parents. I feel like a total failure and completely worthless. I feel like I am being punished by God  and there is no way out. Even in my dreams I can't escape the pain. I can't see the good in anything anymore. Everywhere  I see pain and suffering  with no hope. Even when I meet incredible people who am in awe of  I feel almost envious  knowing that I am a worthless  useless nothing in the presence of angels. I still have some friends  but have grown distant from them. Seeing their success  no matter how minute  just reminds me of my worthlessness. I have nothing to offer the world. I am without purpose.  Even when I have enough things to distract me  my ex is still in my dreams or nightmares every night. Before I met her  I got my life on track  was kicking ass in school  and headed for something. I know I can't blame her  but I just feel so stupid for getting caught up in her drama for no reason. What a waste.  I don't know. I've been reflecting on my life a lot. I'm 27 and have nothing to show for it. I feel like I have to make drastic changes. Liquor and drugs are not doing me any good. I don't know what the hell I want anymore. I'm so lost  sometimes I don't even know if I'm really alive.  I feel like right now  I have to settle for mediocrity and hope for simple low - stress job that pays the bills  but I don't have any source of joy or anything really to look forward too.  I've pinpointed that the major source for depression and life problems as been my self-hatred. It manifests itself in many forms  including obsessive feelings of inadequacy and incompetence  paranoia  being overly - sensitive to criticism  feeling worthless  hopeless  and giving up too easy because of those feelings.  Where did all this self - hatred come from? I don't want to blame my parents at my age  but I know that how they treated me when I was younger affected me and it still lingers in my psyche. They always employed the shame approach to parenting. Anytime something happened  my father would curse at me  and lecture me on how worthless I was. He would glare at me  and I just had to sit there and listen. Sometimes I would start crying  and then he would yell at me for crying  and say shit like ""look at you  you're not even ashamed."" Shame was apparently a virtue. My mother once told me when I was 8 that she wanted to have a third child  but because I was such a disappointment  she decided against it. They hit me frequently  with a bamboo stick. I remember they would constantly compare me to their friend's children  praising them and ask me why I couldn't be more like them.  So all this happened  but I can't change the past. I don't want to dwell and blame my parents for their mistakes  no one is a perfect parent. I just want to get over these feelings of self - hatred and get my life in order. I've identified the source of my depression  but haven't been able to change all those feelings and thought-processes that have been ingrained in me since early childhood. Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome these feelings  and gain a sense of confidence and direction back? ",1
" I'm 25 years old single black mother and I've been struggling with depression ever since I was a small girl. Throughout the course of my life I have had a lot of share of ups and downs: parents divorced in 1985  father was on drugs  domestic abuse  severe teasing  idiotic boyfriends and the list goes on. If there were problems in the home  you dealt with it at home and kept your mouth shut tight. There is no such thing as a black woman being depressed. Black women MUST keep this aura of being strong  independent  swallow your tears  raise your children  take the blows that life throws at you and keep moving with the beat. If you didn't keep moving with the beat  then you will fall through the cracks; everyone sees it and you will be considered as weak and no one will want to deal with you. Everyone around you will let you have it and you will be labeled as an outcast among your fellow black sisters and brothers. I have had a few suicide attempts and my family thought that I was just trying to get sheer childish attention as to say  ""I'm a big baby  pay attention to me."" They took it as a joke and it broke my spirit down to a trillion pieces. I constantly worried what my friends  co-workers  class mates  and lovers would see me as a walking disaster waiting to happen. At the time  I did a good job of ""covering it up"" for a long time. It painfully and slowly came out. I was afraid that if I told some one that I was severely depressed  I would not get the love  support  and care that I needed: family labeled me as ""CRAZY"". So if you have any comments please feel free to let me know what you think about black women and depression.",1
 I'm 23 years old female. i began lexapro February 8 2006  My doctor gave me lexapro. i have used zoloft when i was like 16 years old but only used it for a month. my question is   is there anyone who's been on lexapro and how has it worked for them. the first day i took it which was yesterday i took my first pill in morning 10 mg i felt dizzy and i felt like my head was expanding and felt sleepy but then again i would always sleep a lot before this.  my sex drive is gone. i feel i don't have no urge whatsoever.  i don't have no craving for food as much as i did before. or maybe because i was bored and depressed i just ate but i don't know. and i see a lot of people who say they gained and lost weight on this pill but I've only been on it for 2 days so i can't say nothing yet on that. i will be coming back to update on how I'm doing.  but anyone on lexapro please feel free to comment. I'd love to hear what you have to say.,1

 I was wondering what people's viewpoints are on for being on medication ...  because it seems like getting the right combo of medications seem tricky and if you don't get the right combination  you still remained depressed ... or worse than before?   I'm curious to know what the myths .. vs non myths about antidepressants  antipsychotics  mood stabilizers  etc?   Do they make you feel worse?  They say that the medications generally make you feel more like yourself than different ...  but it takes some 6 months to get attuned to them?  Is that correct?  I've been trying to fight off my depression for over 10 years - I think it's a factor from childhood abuse.  In recent years  perhaps my nerves have grown thin ... and I'm slowly wearing myself out ...  my friends have recommended more therapy since I see a school counselor once every two weeks.   But it's difficult to really focus on my emotion health when I know that I'll be relocated in two months  .. and I feel that my current emotional stability is just shaky..   Is it advisable to start medications without therapy and then when I relocate to wherever I find a job ... then begin therapy there?  (In other words  I've never been on medications before)  Any advice would be helpful. ,1
 I hope this posts ... I am not feeling good at all. I feel as if I am an outer shell filled with fire that I can not let out. It hurts so much and I don't know what to do. I keep praying but I can't seem to be able and control it. I don't feel worthy. Even this post will probably be deleted. It probably will be because all I ever do is never good enough. I try to try but nothing ever happens. I go to therapy  she said I have 14 personalities ... I hate myself so much right now. I agree not to get on one forum then I go to another ... am I addicted to sadness? Grief? I hate myself so much. I am sick of myself and I just want to scream. Why do I think this way ...  ,1
 I have so much pent up anger that I carry around with me all the time. It seems as though it's about 4 years old and it's now catching up to me. And I'm telling people off left and right. I will honestly admit  I talk a lot of shit and in the end people somehow walk all over me. Well  not any more and not this time. I always have a string of bad luck and tonight was no different when I was at brooks picking up some medications and the cashier slammed my change down and threw my slip at me. I told her off then formally complained about her. And you know something? It felt damn good  defending myself.  Maybe it will boost some confidence in me because I have none ,1
 I had skipped work today because this dream was too good to just let the alarm clock interrupt it. I've been able to hold onto my dreams a lot lately. Such as I can wake up and roll over and fall back asleep in the exact spot in the dream I left off....  Now the dream is I'm at some party. The room is very lavish looking. And everyone there I know. Feels like this party was somehow for me. Never has ever happened. Now the part that stands out is that I see my teacher who was my mentor she was everything to me. When I was in high school I not only had this HUGE crush on her but she was the kind of actor I had always wanted to be except I was willing to die for my art. Still am. She's sitting with her two kids. They're probably the most gorgeous kids I've ever seen and she hasn't changed. Her husband is in the distance somewhere. I never see him but I am aware of him. I thank her for all her time and effort she put into me and I ask her how it's going with her life and if she's still teaching. We talk about something else and the dream slowly fades away.  Reality is I haven't heard from this teacher since I graduated. I heard she had a kid and she moved to vermont. I miss her terribly. Somehow this dream seems to have more than just one meaning. And since everyone else has dream threads I'm going for one too. ,1
 New members. I am 51 and have to take antidepressants for life. Now that I have accepted the fact I can get on with the things I want to do. My interests are varied  also hobby and I do lots together. When I had depression and anxiety I couldn't leave the house. which wasn't much of a life for him. Therapy also helped over the years. I filtered out what I needed during my conversations with a psychologist and have used those coping skills. My family doctor [GP] is a Great help and very supportive. Have a look round DF and join in! You're sure to get an answer but do allow for the time zone differences)  You'll find me in the OCD room.,1
" I'm a single white gentleman  27. I've dealt with depression since the age of 7  and it has gotten worse over the years. Not having any family / friends is not helping any (it's been this way for years now). My depression got really bad when I graduated from high school and my parents turned their backs on me. While everyone else was looking forward to a bright future  my parents had the attitude of ""screw you  you're on your own"". They refuse to help me in any way  which has caused unbelievable problems for me (unemployment being the biggest thing). Having a friend is not the cure - all  but it would definitely help a lot. I feel so hopeless and alone. I tried other internet groups  but found them to be nothing but a waste of time. Just looking for someone who can relate  and won't judge me. I am fully aware that this is not a dating site  but I would prefer to find a female friend. If anyone is interested and / or has any questions about me  feel free to contact me.",1
" Just some curious questions here. I am recently undergoing lots of stress in my life. My work is failing and I am struggling keeping up. I recently have a new born in the family as well and extra workload at home too. I noticed these few symptoms:1) Often worrying  going in a loop worrying even about small things 2) Very easily agitated  get angry very easy 3) Weird sleeping pattern  can't sleep at night and sleep 10-12 hours straight during the day 4) Hard to concentrate at anything serious  easily distracted 5) Have up and down moments  sometimes it feels as though nothing has happened  sometimes it hits hard and I could waste one whole day just sitting at home being totally non productive. 6) Easily give up at everything I do  everything seems to be hopeless at times. I am putting off going to the doctors for a long time now. I previously been to the doctors and was given 2 different kind of antidepressants and I really felt awful taking them and stopped. I am reluctant going back because of the same reason. Is this a serious matter that warrants me to see the doctor again? Just hate the feeling but I noticed the ""downs"" have been coming on more and more lately due to more stress load. Please advice  and if possible give some advice concerning the medication I am most likely to be given if I go to the doctors as well...thank you.",1
 You don't have to read this  it's just a short story.  A few years ago i was in love with a guy  we were in the same course at school.  I got so nervous every time I saw him. However  he didn't say a word to me. He ignored me. He didn't even look at me. I didn't want to ignore him  i tried to get his attention  but i just didn't manage. It frustrated me. I just didn't understand why he deliberately ignored me. I was so down  I started cutting again  didn't eat for days  ...  It lasted one year. The whole year he never said a word to me. Not even when my sister died.  I don't understand it today and I never will. I never will forget the pain. However  i don't blame him for ignoring me. Everybody has the right to ignore me. But it hurts me so much.  And today I always get the feeling people ignore me. And when people i care about do so  it's horrible. Maybe they don't deliberately ignore me  but i always think they do. For me it's the worst thing you can do to a person. It's worse than hating somebody.  I wrote a poem for this guy  it's not good  but i want to share it.  Don't blame me  Don't blame me for thinking of you  because you just don't know how i feel  You never knew me and you never will  but i know you so well  yes i do.  Don't blame me for dreaming of you  because you just don't know how much it hurts  You are so far away  but you're in my dreams  there i can reach you  yes i can.  Don't blame me for searching for you because you don't know how much i miss you  You never looked at me like i look at you  I need you  i always will  Don't blame me for loving you  because you just don't know how i feel  You never knew me and you never will  but i love you so much  yes i do. ,1
 I don't know if doing this right  but putting it down 'on paper' gets it out of my head  at least temporarily  and i'm dying inside. i'm trapped! i feel so low  unwelcome familiar thoughts in my head  and nowhere to turn. my two teenage kids in bed  my bloke away at his kids for weekend  I want to cry  but can't anymore. Don't want to bring anyone down with my feelings but so lonely at moment. life has nothing new to offer me and it seems so easy to leave it all  but how can I when i have two beautiful kids upstairs. Can't do that to them  and that's why i feel so low. hate life  always have. feel comfortable in depression after a while and that's when i get to point of not caring who i hurt. had several episodes through teens and adult life  drink used to help  unemployment let me be selfish  being single mom meant i didn't have to explain my feelings  but this is first episode since been with partner of 3 years. he won't understand  and i just dread tomorrow when he comes home. just want to sleep and never wake up. trapped  angry I'm trapped  feel selfish for feeling this way  and that makes me even angrier. any parents out there understand what i mean? ,1
 Feeling Good is an excellent book. I have re-read a few times when I've felt the need. If you are looking at something for anxiety and panic  I suggest Mastering Anxiety and Panic revision III (map-3) by David Barlow. I suffered from anxiety  panic attacks and agoraphobia from the time I was 12 until last year...that's 30 years. Nothing had ever helped until I found a therapist that uses that program. A different way of looking at things and I have to say that I worked miracles for me. I am driving  flying  going to concerts  sporting events...things I haven't done for over 20 years. I NEVER thought I could get better and only went because my boyfriend of 8 years was honest with me and told me that he didn't know if he could spend the rest of his life going every place alone. That was a wake up call for me and to my surprise  I found that I COULD do it. I still have my depression and I am endlessly working on being medicated correctly for that.... all of you know how that is. You can buy just the workbook www.oup.com (Oxford University Press). Well worth the money.,1
 Hi I'm a 20 year old gal from west coats of Scotland and i feel i need somewhere to spill my thoughts. I'm a student nurse with 2 part time jobs and college so obviously in stressed and id doesn't help that I'm in a big bit of debt. I'm listening to songs which usually maked me happy and i cry  I tend to drink quite a bit because I'm so unhappy  i don't know what to do   I feel as though everyone is passing me by in my life I'm overweight which doesn't help the situation although i am trying to lose it. it doesn't work. I've been in trouble with the police as i went off the rails i started taking drugs which made me happy and then got warnings from the police. I seem to be writing this and not making any sense to my self. Does anyone else feel like this as i feel as i feel like I'm the only one that feels like this. I sit and wonder what it be like if i didn't exist would anyone miss me would anyone notice if i didn't turn up for college or work. My life feels so useless there are people dying from disease and instead of me they could have a longer life if they took my place  i don't know what else to do i cant talk openly about how i feel so i have to resort to a web based environment   don't think i don't have plenty of friends because i do i just feel as they have enough to worry about instead if thinking about me. If anyone else out there wants to chat feel free. Wouldn't blame you if you didn't. The best times of my life at the moment are when I'm sleeping.,1
 I'm losing my mind and don't know where to put it for safe keeping. If only I could just put it in a little box  wait for the insanity to subside and then take it out and it would be unharmed. Lately I feel as though I've been more crazy than usual. I can't stand human contact  not just from my wife  but from anyone  a handshake  a hug  anything. I just tense up and can't breathe. What the **** is wrong with me? Yet I lay in bed wanting her to hold me  but when she does  I can't breath  it has nothing to do with how she is cuddling up against me  it's just how I start to feel. I hate feeling like this because it makes her feel like she is less than desirable or that she did something wrong. She didn't. I still love her. I need her. I'd be dead w/o her that's for sure. The good doctor is on vacation this week  I may leave her a message about this latest 'issue' just because I know myself. I won't bring it up next time I see her and then it will continue to bother me. It's like I need to go in w/ a list pinned on my shirt of things I'd really like to talk about. Because I get there and I can't speak. And I hate the awkwardness of sitting there  staring into someone's eyes  knowing there are things you should be saying but you can't. I'll get over it. I always do. That's my motto and I'm believing it less and less lately. Oh well. Monday will be here in 10 min and I need to go to bed. See you tomorrow.,1
" I am currently on Zoloft - 25 mg a day  and my once high sex drive has evaporated.  I am only 24 and my boyfriend doesn't understand why the sudden complete lack of interest in sex.  It causes a lot of problems  and frankly - I feel like I'm too young to not enjoy / want sex.  The Zoloft in general helped a lot more in the beginning - now i still get quite anxious but I don't have the ""head that won't turn off.""  My doctor  though not excited about it  because it's a different class  has told me to start weaning off Zoloft and onto Wellbutrin.  I guess I'm nervous because I don't want to go back to feeling out of control and I was just wondering how everyone else has done comparatively  on Wellbutrin vs. Zoloft.",1
 i am mad and sad  i suffer from depression i have a problem with my family  at first i thought i had a problem but more and more i see that it's not me the only problem is everybody else say it's me ......  i have three sisters who are all older than me they try to control every aspect of my life. i am 27 years old last june i lost my job and had to move with one of my sisters at first things were fine and then she started to degrade me in front of her friends i tried to ignore her for about 3 months she was verbally abusive to both me and my children i did everything i could to keep the house clean and please her but she always found a reason to dog me out one day we had an argument and i stood up for myself and she was on the phone with a friend while doing so   later on that day her friend called me and invited me and my children to stay with her at first i was scared because i didn't know her well and i didn't know what my sister had already told her about me but i didn't want to take my kids to the shelter they had already experience so much.  so i moved with the friend who is very caring and understanding and my depression was ok for a while.  i was waiting on a low income apartment and they finally called but meanwhile my mom told me my sisters were upset because none of us has ever depended on anyone outside of the family and i am stupid and betrayed the family. but every time i need my family they are never there and if they are they give you lectures and tell everyone your business so i feel alone confused and when i move i don't want to be bothered but i don't have any friends and i don't want to isolate myself because it is unhealthy am i wrong to not want to be bothered or is this a classic case of me being selfish and not wanting to hear the truth from my family below i will give a brief history someone please help!  been on my own since age 17  never been without work  love my children with all my heart  was in a great relationship but family didn't like him so   you know what happened! and never got into any family politics always accepted all for who they were  and finally when diagnosed with depression at age 19 everyone i know told me i am depressed because i want to be and i could change if i chose to .  what should i do?   ,1
 i have been on celexa for a month now ... at first it was great ... i was dizzy and drowsy but my moods were much better i had a tolerance that i never had before ... the bad part was i couldn't eat ... i'm over that now! .. lol ... i do however have the oddest sleep patterns  i fall asleep everyday around 4 for an hour ... but can't seem to get to sleep at night ... i wake up tired .... as for the end of this month i feel normal .... or maybe i'm just used to it ... the one thing that bothers me is i'm normally a emotional person ... and i fear that i've become numb ... i don't feel things the way i used to ... which is i guess the point of it ... i've experienced weight loss however ..... i'm grateful for what it has done for me ... i am able to see my situation clearly and think about myself now.,1
 I had my second appointment with my naturopathic doctor today. I'm getting this feeling that she is really just a therapist for people who don't want to go to a therapist. She lets me ramble on about all sorts of things that have very little to do with my health. Like what our rules for Jeffrey and food are. Last time she gave me a series of homeopathic remedies (Undas) to support my liver. This time it was a capsule called Ichol. I'm not sure if these things do anything more than lighten my wallet  but I'm willing to try them for now. I do desperately need to lose weight and if there is any chance that these things will help  I'm willing to go for it for a while. I've been searching the net reading about Katirina and other personal tragedies that bloggers are going through and I'm sort of jealous. My life is just full of 'normal' stuff right now. My grandpa died in August and we went to his funeral but it doesn't affect my life in a large way. Just in the morally rehensible way that now I don't have to feel guilty about not going to see him. It's not that I didn't want to see him  I just never found the time and now I don't have to worry about it. At some level I'm sure that means that I'm headed to eternal damnation. In other news  we've managed to find a geo-cache. It took us three trips to the spot because dusk is not the time to find dark colored boxes hidden in an unlit forest. Even if it is just 2 kilometers southwest of our house on a really nice nature trail.,1
" i am a 16 year old. i think i am depressed  but i don't know how to tell. um...it is like i am afraid to tell my parents because i know them  they will brush it off as no big deal or make me sit down and tell them what is going on. Did they ever think that i don't want to talk to them? My mother is like a roller coaster ride you cannot wait to get off of. One day she could care less that i am sick  or that i need to tell her something  and then the next day she is all  talk to me  tell me what is going on. God it can be so annoying. i know that i have a problem with my emotions  i just can't seem to control them  when i am upset  stressed  angry  sad. There are always three things that i do. First i cry  then i scream  then i run to my room  and sometimes i might knock something down. And that gets me another  what is going on talk. Two years ago my grandma died. We weren't that close and i think that is part of my problem. every time i try to go to sleep i just lay there and think about my life  and realize  there isn't that one person  you know  everyone has one  that one person that you can just call up and say  ""hey  i am in a bad mood  can you talk..."" or ""hey i just got in another stupid fight with my mom  do you have time to talk to me..."" and maybe that is what is wrong with me  i don't have someone to vent to so i keep it all inside. i mean i try and find ways to let my anger and frustration out like  i am a poet  sort of. Everyone tells me i am at least  but what they don't seem to understand is that maybe i am a good poet because i have nowhere else to let all of this out. No one can see that  no one can see that i need someone to talk to. i try and talk to my mom  but she is so busy  and that is not her fault  it isn't like she is ignoring me on purpose  she has school  she has work  she has my brother's wrestling match  she has a meeting. then i try and talk to my friends  and i know that they would listen and they would try and understand  but i don't know  i just don't feel as though they need all of my crap on their shoulders  not that you do either  who ever is still reading this. i guess it is that sometimes  i feel ignored. i turned sixteen this year. Happy Sweet Sixteen...right? i wanted to have a party  i wanted to go out and have a good time. But that didn't exactly work out the way i had planned. At first i thought that my friends had forgotten about me  no call on my birthday  no card. And then they threw me a surprise party  nothing big and fancy  just small  just the four of us  the way we like it  but still it felt weird  it just didn't feel right. i am supposed to be driving  i have my temporary permit  i have had them since October  you know how much i have driven  about one hour. i could have gotten my license last month  but i cannot go to driving school until i get more experience  and i can't get more experience until one of my parents decides to let me drive. They used to take my brother out all the time  they would let him drive everywhere. i don't know  i just feel like sometimes being the middle child and the only girl i get ignored. i am a cutter. i tried to tell my parents three times that i was a cutter and i wanted to stop. i couldn't tell them in words so i wrote them a letter  they never read it. you probably think i am some selfish person  but i just have been holding all of this inside of me for three months now and there is more down inside of me  i just need to slowly let it out. Sorry if this took up to much of your time. Thank you for listening to me...it feels nice to know that maybe there is someone out there listening.",1
 I am Mark  this is my first post on here. I am feeling really scared of myself at the moment  I have been depressed to some extent for as long as i can remember  and have had many hospital admissions in the past  but for the past few years life has been manageable  I have been in a relationship  not a very good relationship but one that helped me feel safe  i stopped overdosing and cutting  the relationship as i said had its downsides i am not sure love is the word to describe what we had but it was a strong feeling whatever it was  and now that we are no longer together i realize that whatever we had was stronger than anything i had before. i am so lonely and have very scary thoughts  you see my partner has moved back to his home country as he had no choice he was living here illegally  the days we were together before he left i started to have very disturbing thoughts  i even thought of killing him as it would be easier than living without him!!! that is very scary. now that he is gone all the old feelings i used to have about myself and the hatred i have for myself is showing again  he was my protector  my distraction i suppose. but now i don't have that i feel it is only a matter of time until i do some thing really stupid. i have not acted yet as i do not what to have a 'failed' attempt  i am not sure i want help  that is why i am looking here first maybe after this rant i will understand what is happening a bit more  maybe not. all i know at this point is i would rather not be alive  not sure i want to kill myself but i don't want to be alive  don't know if that makes sense,1
 I'm so mad at myself.  Angry more like it.  I truly hate myself right now.  My wife and I are currently separated  and it's all my fault.  I know  I know  'don't blame yourself'.  Well  the truth is that it is all my fault this time.  I did some pretty terrible things to my wife and family to make them leave.   I also opened my mouth when I should have just kept it shut.  I said some pretty stupid things over the past year plus.  I had become some sort of monster  and didn't know what to do.  When it got found out about  I told my wife that I wanted her to take the kids and get away from me.  Why did I do that?  I love my wife very much  and don't want to lose her.  I just don't know how to express that to her.  I'm so angry that I just want to hurt myself.  I don't care how or what happens.  I want things to go back to the way they were before I started having my problems.  I just want to shout and hit something or someone.   I wish someone could help me.  I am seeing a therapist  but I don't know if it is helping.  My mind is still a jumbled up mess.  My life is even worse  and I don't know what to do to make it better.   I feel so down and out of it.  I can't sleep  I don't want to stay awake.  I don't feel like eating at all.  I just don't think I care much any more.  What good will it do to get my life straightened out if I don't have anyone to share my new life with.   I've been so unhappy and depressed for so long  I'm not sure I even remember how to be happy.  Why do I feel this way all the time?  I'm so unhappy all the time that my wife thinks that it is her that I am unhappy with.  Honestly  I don't know any more.  What's wrong with me?  I see all these happy couples walking around  and here all these happy Christmas carols being played on the radio  and I get very jealous.  Why can't I be happy like that?  Why couldn't I be happy with what I had?  I had everything that I ever wanted  a loving  beautiful wife  two great kids  and one more on the way.  I should have been the happiest man in the world.  Instead  I screwed it all up and lost everything that I held dear to me.  What kind of idiot does something like that?  I just needed to rant a little.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  I just don't know what to do now. ,1
  i don't really  know what I'm doing here but i think i better get this out because it's driving me crazy and i really need to do something and stop thinking!  is it normal to be reaching out? i think that in the past looking back  i have tried to reach out and every time it just got screwed up. i feel stupid but i think it's like i need to know that someone knows that I'm in pain. is that rrlike normal?  the first time i wrote a letter to friends  school found it and called my guardian. i then was forced to a doctor who i lied to and ran away from as if nothing ever happened. next it was an email  school found out  school counselor persuaded principal for her to deal with it. went to another doctor and ran away from it once more. now I've left school  no school counselor anymore with shit still going on and me still not dealing well with it. since then i have spent so much money on credit where i started to message wrong numbers 'accidentally' - how lame is that?! i still talk to one lady that replied who also suffers depression. one night it went too far and i ended up being taken to hospital because of what i wrote ... and now I'm here.  do you think that this stupid reaching out will stop if i go to a doctor or counselor? is this what my problem is  that i need to know someone knows I'm in pain? why do i feel like this?  anyone? ,1
 There is a genetic weakness in my family - virtually everyone has been on medications at some time  or is on medications now  for depression and anxiety disorders. It seems to onset around puberty. I have had a truly horrible time over the last 3 years supporting my depressed daughter (now aged 15) and  more recently  my 22 year old son. I have been taking 340 mg of St John's Wort once a day for about a year  but I am aware that the genes are kicking in  and I am now quite ill in my own right. I really don't want to take prescription medications  as I have seen the horrible side effects that my daughter and son have experienced as the medications have kicked in - she has had to change medications once as she reacted so badly. Just from looking at the size of the St John's Wort pills available  it is obvious that I could take a much higher dose. Does anyone know anything about dosage  and whether it would be better to take doses throughout the day rather than just once?  Incidentally  Valerian Root is great for sleeplessness - if you can stand the smell! ,1
" My name is Maria  I'm 37 and have social anxiety plus some traits of borderline personality disorder.  I've been taking Prozac for the last eight years and have been seeing a psychiatrist that whole time.  Next week I have an appointment with a therapist (I have only had random therapy sessions during this time).  What I'm really struggling with right now is how I am still single after all these years.  I'll go out with someone about a half a dozen times and then they lose interest  or as the last person said  I freaked him out (really I think he overreacted to a couple of incidents  but I guess if he was freaked out  who am I to argue?)  In 2002 my best friend / ex died in my condo from years of drug / alcohol abuse ... he was going through a rough period at the time  but I really think we would have ended up together .... since then I have had a hard time connecting with anyone else on the same level.  Does anyone else find that people they date are scared off?  Every time someone breaks it off with me  I get very discouraged and that much more ""jaded"" ... with this last person  I even took a day off from work.  Anyone else go through this? ",1
 I am a 31 year old mom of 5. I have a 25 year history of anxiety  depression and OCD. I have spent years of my life trying antidepressant drugs and anti anxiety medications to help with the symptoms but I have been labeled treatment resistant. I either have side effects that I can't tolerate off of the drugs or they just don't work for me.  I walk around every single day either feeling lifeless  numb  helpless  angry or detached from my family. I have no support from my family as I am estranged from my abusive parents and my sisters are not interested in my emotional problems. To make matters worse I suffer from seizures  migraines and asthma which cause me to be prone to bronchitis and pneumonia. I spend a lot of time sick and in pain.  I have five kids to raise. Two of them are disabled. They have severe speech disorders that make them behave in a negative way. It makes me feel frustrated. My oldest daughter has problems in school because she is having problems with her vision. She may have dyslexia.  I never get out of the house except to go to Walmart or the grocery store. I can't drive because of my seizures and my husband never keeps a consistent schedule. I am housebound and lonely. I see a therapist when I can and he has actually told me he is amazed I haven't killed myself by now with the stress I am under. I am burnt out and sinking fast. Does anyone have any good advice for me?  I do not have a support network so forget about that. I can't make it to support groups so that is out. I am alone except for my children and my computer addicted husband. Please help me figure out how to cope with my life. Right now I am dealing with my new seizure medication and the ongoing problem I am having with hair loss for no apparent reason. I am very depressed about it.  Any advice is appreciated. Please don't take this as me whining about my life. I really am not. I am just trying to figure out where my place is in all of this confusion. ,1
 I have now had BAD night sweats on and off for about 4 years. I am only 32  so it's not menopause and at this point I am pretty sure they are from my antidepressants. I have now tried about 4 - 5 different antidepressants to try to get rid of them but nothing has worked. About 4 years ago I got night sweats when I tried Zoloft which is known for causing them  so I switched to Prozac which never caused them and I was fine  for awhile. Then one day I just started getting night sweats and over the years I tried to get rid of them by switching to Wellbutrin  Effexor  Serzone (I think) and Cymbalta to no avail. My night sweats get worse depending on the season and humidity. At their worst  which as been for the past 2 weeks since the weather change  I am soaked all night  clothing  sheets  pillows  blankets - everything. Then I freeze when I get up to change my clothes or go to the bathroom because I am soaking wet.  I am basically at the end of my rope. I no longer know what to do and my doctor's just choked it up to my antidepressants so they say there is nothing I can do.  Has anybody gone through this and found a solution? Help please. ,1
  I've had United Healthcare as my health insurer for 7 years. For the past 6 years they have dutifully paid 80% of my weekly visits to my psychiatrist without any problem. Then  quite suddenly last August  they stopped paying my doctor anything for my visits. The insurer say that I'm only entitled to 30 mental health visits per year according to the contract  but my doctor insists that the insurer is required to forewarn her and me the patient when benefits are about to expire. Neither of us received any notice that my benefits were about to expire. My doctor and I have written letters and called the insurer asking them appeal my case  but they refuse to allow me any more benefits for visits. So I'm going to have to pay my doctor about $4 000 out of pocket.   Is there anything else I can do to fight my insurance company? My doctor and I both feel blindsided by the insurer and are furious. ,1
" this is so stupid  i have gone over and over same old ranting around for years!   i could cheerfully pack my bags and walk out on my three kids - and ex partner  and all the grief  i know i could  yet i know deep down  i don't REALLY want to leave any of them  & couldn't  because the pain and hurt that deep  i put up with the shit because i love them all  i'd do anything i could for any of them   and by god they ALL know it!   - try not to maybe  but all take advantage of it ! i love all of them way too much - it scares me i could be that cold  i can be hard  and nasty  but i CHOOSE not to be like that  because i don't like it. ( although post menstrual week apparently i am hell ! )  i ought to be on meds! i can't bring myself to take them  i try  i know i should  it just might help  i know I'm tense- but honest to god! - being told off  by my son  slagged off  hurt time and time have to constantly break down  ok i suppose in fairness my ex apologizes when it's appropriate to do so  - some times apologies just don't stop it  I'm hell to live with for every one around me  i fall out with people all the time  there's never any peace in the house  people come go & ring at all hours  i want to "" be there "" for everyone  lol - like I'm so helpful  because then next time it's    when they need something  they know they'll get it- because how can i not help? and I'm christian  albeit a bad one i expect!  also if they make me drowsy  and aid sleep - that's great - until son comes home drunk ! ( not loads but maybe once / twice a week  maybe not at all - always when you least expect it though!) / teenagers come round and party  (they are very considerate for teeny boppers may i add and respectful of being able to come back  watching films and drinking / music reasonable 12 / 1 latest - but i wait up for my lad who usually does the walking others back safe bit) also my little girl is adhd  and up very early  i average 4 hours a night - this is also part stress. - every morning i wake to kids fighting  shouting  aruguing. despite fact they meant to stay in own rooms. if I'm not up  it will continue until someone gets hurt  so no lies there! lol  my only babysitters are my ex or my son. i have no other close family.  apart from my dad who lives quite a distance away and is quite elderly  not too great with his mobility.  self confidence is non-existent  i can find loads of reasons for being used  none for being LIKED. as a person.  my son is joining the forces  and on the back of the past few months - it's feeling for me and him like prolonged grief. - we've talked  we both know it'll be hard  it's always been us two against the world as he put it  but yet we still lash out at each other  with the lashing out from all angles ( obviously by me mainly  as it appears to be my hang ups causing all  i REALLY don't know what to do. counseling still not started   i stopped relate  as things are  so hot / cold cold  / warm and communication so awkward - i genuinely thought when i was told forget it that was the case - then boyfriend girlfriend on quite  then hell because of me again  now god only knows but even being considerately polite is a struggle  and humor gone - so is pleasure in anything i do.  - my head is very literally all over the place  i can't get one ""clear"" thing to latch to as such  if that makes any sense?  i have had kids since young n 17 / 18 - never learnt to drive / swim never traveled  never held a career. even study for a year was a nightmare ( i did pass despite a divorce though: english gcse & art acess - lol )  just sick of fighting it out every day  trying to get kids to see why food meant to last a week! silly stuff - every day.  have such a headache trying to map out life so everyone can be content and fulfilled  and feel like for all those i love try  to show  affection  that it comes just before the knife or behind to heal the wound.

 It's been a while since I've written and I decided to start off again with a bit of a bang. I'm going to post my story of beginning recovery  this is to try and cheer some people up and to let them know that they could do it too. Well now  where to start.... About a year and a half ago (the beginning of Grade 8) is when I started to notice the changes. Not physical but emotional. I had been told many times that this was very normal for teenagers so I thought nothing of it. There was an incident with a rather immature and nasty young man  who I just happened to have an ENORMOUS crush on. Anyway we both kind of lead each other on for a while but nothing happened  than he meet this girl at a hockey game. He immediately started talking about her all the time and how he really loved her so much.  I began to feel more and more useless. After that I started rolling down hill like a circle of cheese  and by March of that year I was quite close to suicide at several occasions. This is when I started noticing that this might not be normal and tried many self-help methods  all of which failed. I thought Grade 9 could be a new beginning  it wasn't. My grades were starting to slip and I just couldn't be happy anymore. Finally after a close call in December I told my mum all about my failed attempts and how I was feeling. She agreed to get me a new doctor. I visited her and I got diagnosed with depression and was prescribed Cipralex. Of course that took a while to work too which involved me missing a lot of school  falling really far behind  and having several more close calls. Finally I started feeling a little better and was even stable enough to start going back to school and going to visit my family in the East. Well I just got back from that trip and I have never felt better. I am ready to face the world. That trip was just what I needed. When I get through these next weeks until my birthday all I can see is a varely clear path ahead! For the first time in a year and a half I can concentrate and tolerate less than perfect circumstances. I hope everyone here will feel this way  you can if you just push through! Power to us! Rock on!,1
 it's 3am and i can't sleep. i have got so many thoughts rushing through my head. i've tried writing them down and drawing pictures and doing mind numbing things to try and stop me thinking but it's not working. i just feel so angry for no particular reason.  i feel really violent and have been having thoughts about hurting people. i'm not that kind of person. i haven't cut for nearly 2 months  and i just attacked my legs with a broken glass because i had to get it out of my system somehow.  i don't know what's going on  i haven't been depressed lately i've been feeling pretty good really. i thought i was just getting things back under control and now whoosh i'm losing control again. i just want to stop thinking. i'm actually thinking about banging my head against the wall until my brain slows down. ,1
 i have been taking paxil for 3 weeks . i was on cymbalta for 1 month before my paxil. now i have only had one good day so far. i feel like crap it's scary. i even went to have a aids test along with my blood work because i feel so awful. my hands and feet sweat so bad i drench my shirts . this sucks for a girl .i get hot flashes so much i have to sleep with a fan in my face i hate this and am so worried about the way i feel . is this normal?,1
 I have such a strong urge to just pick my stuff and leave at the moment that it's not even funny. I really  really just want to grab a bus ticket and get out of here. I suppose there are a lot of reasons  but one in particular.  This is going to get a little creepy and it involves incest  so please don't read any further if you're just going to flame me. My brother has an attraction to me which really creeps me out. He's all the time running around the house naked  hitting on me  'helping' me adjust my dresses so his hands can slide dangerously near my chest. It really  really disturbs me. My problem is that he asked me if it was all right if he hung around naked and stuff when I was drunk. I told him yes because I didn't have my mind about me. Now I can't think of how to tell him that it makes me uncomfortable and that I don't want him doing it anymore.  Along with that I just lost my best friend due to depression. I've been trapped in my house for two weeks and I haven't seen my mom  dad  brother  or sister for more than five minutes in this entire time.  I just want to run away from it all. I don't want to kill myself  but I do want to pack and go and just get away from this wretched town. Would it be such a bad thing to leave? I know it would be running from my problems  but maybe I could find easier problems to deal with somewhere else. ,1
" Hello I'm 25 from the UK  I have suffered from depression I would say most of my life  but have only been on medicines (20mg of Prozac) for just over 2 years on and off  I've had times off the medicines and relapsed back into depression and the last time I saw my doctor he said It would be better for me to stay on antidepressants long term. The Prozac is working for me at the moment However I find the medicines interrupt my sleep and I wake 3 or 4 times a night and the sleep I do get is very light and ""dreamy"" sleep  plus I seem to be a bit lightheaded and reckless  on my motorbike for example I do stupid things like speeding and other dangerous stuff (to myself not others)  which before off the medicines I would never do because I was very paranoid and cautious. I was off Prozac for a while late last year and things went down hill fast  I was cutting my arms and wanted to kill myself  I felt I had no reason to live  I was drinking to relive the depression  and I was drinking about 10 to 12 cans of lager(or 3 bottles of wine) a night  thinking about it I was wrecking my liver and feeling even more depressed in the morning  plus I was putting on loads of weight with all the beers  which was another reason to make me feel like crap. After New Year I made the decision (with my doctor) to go back on the antidepressants  and cut the booze almost out (I still drink about 1 or 2 a night but that's all) because things could not get any worse. I feel a lot better  I am back in the gym and getting back into shape  and my job is going well  I am in a recovery stage at the moment  I just hope I don't f--k it up again like before. Anyway I hope everybody on here is ok. Warm Regards to you all",1
" It goes by a few names ..... a spiritual eclipse ... the black hole .... the shadow .... my own prison ... the downward spiral. I've named it a lot of different things ... like it has a life of its own. In a way it does .... my life. For too long and too completely. It's getting better but at times it seemed it couldn't be much worse ... unless I did the unthinkable ...  at least most of the time it's unthinkable. Divorced for a little over a year know ... removed from a wife I came to realize was a classic borderline personality (look it up) ... I never realized how far down I was on the ladder of life and spirit until I got away from the witch / queen. A true chameleon who changed and kept me guessing and off balance for 18 years .. never knowing who to expect. Finally starting to figure it out ... I think. Two DWI's since the split in rapid succession and then finding out I was self medicating without realizing it. No license for the last 10 months (2 to go) and recovering emotionally and financially with Mom and Dad. Thank God someone cares. Two children I had to leave with the Queen of misery because of the threat of false allegations against me if I dared to go for custody. Hungry and lonely for someone to just be nice to me and care about me  ... at least a little bit ... I find myself in my own prison having to acknowledge the fact ""Why would anyone want to have anything to do with me?"" Hard to accept  but the truth ... too much baggage ... my ex's baggage she handed off to me to spare herself her own truth. At times I wished I could just flip a switch and just go away. Times I thought about driving into a bridge abutment or into a truck at the last second. Absolutely crazy stuff. I can now see what was so logical at that time to be so desperate from too much pain suffered by the abuser she was. I can now see the so called glimmer or hint of a silver lining in the most simple of things life offers to everyone each and everyday. Thank God ....... finally. Things will get better and hopefully someday great. I keep trying remind myself things could be a lot worse. Two great healthy kids who love me and miss me terribly. I'm their entire world. I now realize that. That alone has kept me ""here"". Realizing now that I've been lost in that vortex of hell tugging at me for years ... I actually want to keep going on to life's next challenge. That spells hope and progress in itself. I've made it this far after going through hell with her ... why stop know when things are just starting to look up I don't want to go back into that dark hole that life was for far too long. ",1
" I am 30 and fighting with my depression for almost 2 years now. I had psychosomatic problems all the time. Until July  I was on medication with SSRI (selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors) which helped me a lot but never completely and then for some months none. Now I consulted another doctor and decided to try with different medicine called Remeron. But my question might sound not related .... I somehow think that contraceptive pills (antibaby pills) that I used somehow contributed to my ""state of art"". I used them for 3 months because my gynecologist advised ( she thought that I had some problem with hormones; she did not even check my blood!) and when I stopped with this ""therapy"" I experienced ""total breakdown of the system"". Now  this pills somehow simulate pregnancy  and there is phenomenon of postpartum depression (the baby blues) and the women over 50 quite often develop depressions (hormones again!) ......!!!  So  I would like to ask if somebody had similar experience with contraceptive pills?! ",1
 Hi  i joined earlier last year in quite a bad state. doubt if anyone will remember me!  I kind of  sort of 'snapped out' of it if that's at all possible. I realized i wasn't just upset  but i was never diagnosed as depressed  so i'm so sorry if I'm offending anyone by posting here.   But you guys really helped me when i was last here.  From the start of this year i've been so 'down' it's unreal. At first i put it down to stress of january exams but even though the exams are over i am still so miserable (for want of a better word). I have a great boyfriend who i love very much and vice versa. we have been going out for about 6 months and everything is going great  but my moods are starting to put a strain on him (tom).  i have put it down to the fact that I am really low on self esteem at the moment for some reason  but i don't want get up in the morning because i just don't feel i can face anyone. i LOVE shopping  it makes me feel so good  but it doesn't do anything for me now. I get a bit of Seasonal Affective Disorder  and even sun showers haven't cheered me up.  Because i'm so down i've become really irritable lately  like permanent PMT and like i said  i think its really starting to put pressure on tom  because he's always on the receiving end of my moods.  I don't want to mess everything up or slip too far down the depression road again.  I just don't know what to do or how to explain things to tom (my boyfriend).  Any words of wisdom you could offer me? i think things really might be in trouble. ,1
 I don't particularly want to go into details about how I've been feeling the past couple of years  only because it's too much for me to go into  and I don't want to leave out important details or anything. In September 2005  I voluntarily admitted myself to the hospital's psych ward through my psychiatrist  the reason being because my depression had grown so severe that my muscles gave out and I couldn't move anymore  and my will to live had vanished entirely  I stopped eating  I was dehydrated  I stopped going to school  all I did was lay in bed all day  it's the only thing I could do. The decision to go to the hospital turned out to be a very  very big mistake  and I regret making that choice. I felt no connection with the other kids there  especially because I was a week away from turning eighteen  and most of them were thirteen  fourteen  and maybe one or two sixteen year olds. We were similar in an emotional aspect  but otherwise I couldn't relate to any of them. I just bored them  and the way they talked and the things they talked about just confused me. I did get involved with them to an extent during the last couple of days there  but I regret that now. This is a story in itself  but I also got involved with a girl there. She fell in love with me  and so did I fall in love with her  briefly. Only because a girl had never shown any attraction to me before  nor did a girl ever show any interest in me like she did. My feelings for her quickly faded after talking to her a couple of times outside the hospital. She turned out to be a real mess of a person. I did not suffer from the relationship  though. I do not talk to her anymore  and I actually became a better person because of it - I was enlightened. My depression practically disappeared following my discharge from the hospital. I don't know if it was because of the Zoloft that I had begun taking  or because I was finally free from that prison. By the way  I do have a form of claustrophobia. I am not particularly afraid of being in narrow or tight spaces... I am afraid of being locked in narrow or tight spaces. And the hospital was very small  and they did not let you leave or go where you wanted. You were confined to your room  the main recreation room  and the hallway connecting those two places. The day before I was discharged  I was constantly shaking  sweating  and going to the bathroom. I couldn't sleep  and I was afraid to move. I had to stay in my room most of the time and skip out on the group sessions. So anyway  even though I felt better right after getting out of the hospital  that quickly  VERY quickly changed. By mid-late October  I was on home-schooling (and will be until I graduate in June this year  I am a Senior in High School)  and attending group therapy several days a week  as well as seeing a psychologist once a week and a psychiatrist every several weeks. All of this therapy did NOT help me. I was feeling extremely depressed and suicidal one night  after a brief fight with my dad (I accidentally bumped the curb while parking  he yelled at me to watch the curb  and I got very upset  pulled the parking break  and walked off while screaming about slitting my throat...)  and called one of the therapists at my group therapy to help me. I'd locked myself in a room in my grandmother's basement  and I had called her so she could talk with me and help me to relax. Instead  she threatened to call the police if I didn't open the door and let my dad in. So I opened it  but after that I completely lost my trust in her and couldn't stand being around her anymore. Another counselor at the group therapy also lost my trust. I felt a connection with him  and trusted him a lot  so I told him about my girlfriend (whom I had met online - another story) and he kept on accusing me of things... like using her for sex  or not really being in love  and etcetera. So after having lost trust in two therapists  and then all sorts of insurance problems came up. I stopped going. A few weeks ago  I stopped going to my psychologist as well. I felt like I was being lectured by him instead of actually helped... On top of that  he was taking weekly co-pay from me while he knew my insurance did not require co-pay for anything psychological! (i.e. Counselors  psychologists  psychiatrists  etc.) And he still owes me a couple hundred bucks. He also charged my insurance for appointments I had cancelled. Basically  I took two steps forward  and then three steps back. My depression is not as bad as it was in September 2004  but I am pretty much tired of living. I am constantly thinking of suicide  and have even written brief suicide notes and made plans (which I never carried out). My Zoloft has been at 150mg for the past couple of months. It's helped my social anxiety slightly  but my depression - no. I am aware of the state that I am in  and I am simply tired of it. My future is all dark  I don't see things getting better. When I spoke with my girlfriend this weekend  I cried the entire night...  I just couldn't take everything anymore. I saw a new psychologist last week  but again  I feel like I'm being lectured. I am eighteen years old  and being talked to as if I were twelve. It's insulting and makes me feel even more left out of things than I already do. I don't know. ,1
 My name is Jessica. I'm 21 years old and my boyfriend and I have just broken up after 2 years. I'm not sure where to begin ... our bickering and fighting started about a year ago and even though it was always small stupid things we were fighting about I guess it all built up in the end ...   I know it's probably for the best but I love him and hate the thought of losing him ... he means the world to me ... I just feel like things will take so long to get back to normal with me  especially because we are living together ... I'm in college hence living in student apartments ... I don't want him to move out because i don't want to be totally alone here .. I'm going to miss him and his stupid and crazy ways but most of all his company (when we weren't fighting   or when he was over reacting about things!!!!!!!!) I just don't know what to do at the moment.  I'm sure in a few months i'll move on but I'll never get over it.  he said he still loves me and that maybe in a few months or years we might get back together because he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life with anyone else but me  but i just cant deal at the moment. I'm beginning to think from reading other messages that i may be really slightly depressed or anxious or something ....  a lot has happened in my life and he knows it all ... i just didn't know who i can really talk to about such personal issues anymore ... ,1
 My twenty year old sister died instantly in a car accident in march of 2005. It has been almost a year  and i have never had a dream about her  until tonight. In the dream  she goes from one family member to another  asking why we are ignoring her. She is extremely upset  and screaming that she doesn't understand. She sees me  starts toward me; and then i wake up. The overall sensation of the dream is that she stayed behind to take care of her fifteen month old daughter  and to give birth to the son she was pregnant with when she died. The strongest thing i picked up from the dream was the sensation that she doesn't know she's dead. Is there any meaning behind this dream? Am I losing my mind?,1
" I'm a 17 year old female from Ontario. When I was 12  my mom's boyfriend at the time raped me for six months every time I was there. When my dad finally got wind of the situation  my mom's boyfriend was taken to court and charged with molestation. I didn't attend the trial. I recently found out that molestation is only ""unwanted touching"" as my friend told me  and wouldn't have included most of what happened. I recently asked my mom what was brought up in court  and it was only 6 counts of molestation  meaning  they only knew of 6 different times where he had touched me and included nothing of what I went through. I now suffer from ptsd. due to it. I have never spoken to anyone about it before. I don't know how to deal with the sense of loss I feel about the situation. I now cut because of it and have terrible nightmares. I avoid being in most relationships because I don't want to tell my lover that I am not a virgin for them because I don't want to talk about what happened because I'm afraid that that will ruin our relationship. I just need some one to talk to ...",1
" When I was 16 I was raped by my boyfriend. I was a virgin at the time and it was really hard to accept that this had happened to me. I thought that somehow if I didn't say anything to anyone or raise a fuss about it it wasn't true. But it only made it worse. When I tried to break up with him he tried to kill me. We worked together and that made it really difficult to avoid him. He told all his friends at work that I had ""given it up to him"" which wasn't true. I was mocked and teased by the people that i felt had grown to be my family.   Now  five years later it is still something that hangs tightly in my mind and heart. It is very hard for me to trust anyone and good relationships have been few. I still look over my shoulder thinking he is going to be there again  following me  stalking me  preying on me.  ",1
" Hi  I am new here and don't know where to start  where to post or anything. I don't know what can help me  but I know that I don't like my self  and I am unhappy most of the time. I am not currently on any medicines (can't even do that right) and have never really been tested or diagnosed with anything other than depression. I live my life day dreaming of what could be and what should be......I am a 38 year old female and my problems started when I was born. I was born to an alcoholic dad whom I loved and a mom who did the best she could whom I love as well. My whole family was in therapy from about the time I was 4 years old. Our family therapist/doctor was Dr. Love  I am not kidding that was his real name. All kinds of things were going on in my family that I was not aware of until I was grown. One was the fact that my real father was sexually molesting my older half sister.......I was labeled a ""bad child"" ""out of control child"" and was locked in my room for hours at the time which was what our doctor told them to do.....I would not cry when I was punished or spanked and my mom would have to stop my dad from whipping me to keep him from killing me I suppose. I was the youngest of 4 children  1 real sister 1 half sister and one half brother. Although after I was grown I found out that my real sister was only half too... I was very creative in a strange kind of way while I was locked in my room. I would open my window a scream for help with my tape recorder on  so when I got tired I could play it back so maybe someone would come......we had big metal blinds in the windows and for some reason I would raise the blind all the way up and tie the string to my door knob when I would go to sleep at night so the blind would fall if anyone opened my door... Crazy huh??? Any way  when I was about 11 years old I was put in a foster home  you know cause I was a bad child. Then I went to group homes  back and fourth here and yonder. Never tested for anything.....never medicated.....I was back and fourth from home  foster homes  group homes and mental hospital from the age 11 to 16. During one of the times I was gone my parents divorced  and my mom moved to a new house. I had met a guy during one of my short stays home  and thought that he was my world. You know by then I thought no one loved me  except for him. He was my world. My oldest sister told me that if we got married I couldn't be sent away any more. She knew how it was being at those places in the 70's and 80's....I mean if you weren't already ""mad"" you would be.....So I married the only person in the world that I thought loved me......As soon as we were married  I got pregnant. He cheated on me  controlled me  I couldn't even go outside without him beating me. He would come in from his girlfriend's house and if I said anything about it  he would go off and throw things and call me every name in the book  take aerosol spray cans and a lighter and throw flames at me until I was in the corner begging and crying for him to stop. He beat me in my stomach and said he hoped I lost the baby. He said if I ever left him he would kill me. I had to get stitches over my eye where he busted it. Of course I lied to the doctor.....scared for my life. All of this went on for a year  when my daughter was born he was not even there. His parents had to go get him out of his girlfriends bed....I was young and dumb. I thought that everything would get better now  I mean he was the only one in the world that ""loved"" me. Things got worse and when my daughter was weeks old he got in one of his moods and was beating on me and his grandma. That's who we lived with. He went out in the yard and took an axe to all the cars and his dad came over to stop him. My husband took the baby out of my arms and held her over his head in the street and threatened to drop her......that's the day I left him. His father called the police and had them come get him. Then he called my mom and told her she had better come get me and the baby if she didn't want us dead. He said that he had got my husband locked up for now  but that it was his son and that he did have to go get him out. So my mom came and helped me pack up and leave...... That is the first chapter of my life......it doesn't get any better.....but it does help to tell all on here. I will tell more later. I need to go to sleep for a while and pass some time. Thanks for the chance to just ramble on here.",1
 The only thing I do is hurt people and say dumb things when I'm mad (really I'm so mad at myself and hate myself so much it seeps out towards others). I know that makes me a very ugly and hateful person.  I don't know how to deal with this anymore. This last year has been the worst (mood problem - wise). I used to have longer periods of relative normalcy in between episodes  but they seem to be happening more frequently this past year. It's too much to deal with.  I am getting treatment and seeing a doctor  but nothing seems to work that great for me. My doctor probably thinks I'm faking it all at this point. I don't really think she has experience treating anything but very mild depression or anxiety.  I feel so low right now. I just don't know or care anymore. What do I do? ,1
" I have lived with depression since I was little. I was molested by my uncle and a family friend and my dad is in and out of prison all the time (I'm guessing that is where it all started from). Well  when I hit my freshman year in high school  I had no friends because I was so shy. I walked the halls alone  went to lunch alone  sat in the back of the classroom alone. I sat back there fantasizing about suicide and death  and I would cut myself  and I actually planned my suicide. By this point I was so far ""out of my mind"" that I couldn't take it anymore  so I went to my mom. I was diagnosed with severe depression  and I've been in counseling on and off ever since. I am now 18 years old  and I have made friends since  and i even got a boyfriend. Well. I haven't seen my counselor for a while now  and in the past few months I feel like my depression is worse than it has ever been. So many things have been happening to me  that I just can't take it anymore. I lost the friends that I had  and I don't even know why exactly. My boyfriend just broke up with me  after we had been together for two years. I've started to cut myself again. i want to be dead. I know I should go to see my counselor  and i tried to make an appointment  but i feel it's too late. i feel like I'm on the edge of a huge cliff  and if I get pushed just a little more  I'm done. i don't know what to do  I just cant take it anymore! If someone could please just give me some advice I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you  Misty  ",1
 I am very new to this forum so if I mess up on some of this edit stuff  I'm sorry. I am 29 years old  I have 4 children that which includes 9 year old twins. I had my last child in 2002. I have had depression ever since. It never went away. I also got married. My life changed completely. People don't even know who I am anymore. The bad thing is I don't even know who I am anymore. I feel like I am living for everyone else. I ask for nothing and expect nothing. I used to set such high standards for myself  I have a diploma and a 2 - year college degree. It means nothing to me now. I have not been able to work in 4 years and I am a person who went to work at 16. MY body is so weak now I take all this medicine and still no sleep. any thoughts will be helpful.,1
 One of the biggest things i'm struggling with (besides my depression duh) is finding a good therapist. I moved about 6 months ago  and I have not had luck finding a therapist that I can work well with. I know that I need help with cognitive therapy  and i've gone to a couple therapists who have cognitive listed as a specialty  but when I get into therapy with them  its all talk therapy with little to no help to me. Don't get me wrong  talking does help  but I know from my years of dealing with this illness that I need some good solid cognitive therapy to help me to overcome my lack of self n worth / self n esteem / confidence.  Also  has anyone had any luck with alternative therapies? ,1
" I've had quite a few life situations that have probably contributed to depression.1. I grew up in an emotionally/sexually abusive family...but the type of abuse that is just over the line enough to mess with your head  to make you wonder if it was really abusive or if you were just sensitive. I still talk to them and see them at times  but vast quantities of things go unsaid. 2. I left home for college  and almost immediately was recruited into a religious cult where I stayed for 14 or so years; I just got out a couple of years ago. 3. I had my first major depressive episode while inside and although I found a supportive therapist  she too was in the cult and therefore some of her advice at times was influenced by their beliefs. Also I was alternately shunned and ostracized  rebuked harshly  or encouraged to give up medicines/therapy by various members in various levels of leadership in the cult. 4. I very recently switched jobs to a much better job situation  but am still adjusting the environment. 5. We're in contract to purchase a home  which is great  but also an adjustment. The Question. My psychiatrist thinks I've been depressed for most of my life. Which makes sense when I look back over my journals and look at various things I did  said or experience. Thing is  to me  depression as a state of mind became normal. I didn't know anything different than how I was feeling. So what happens is this: I mention something I've been experiencing to my therapist. She is concerned and asks if I've brought it up to my psychiatrist. When I do bring it up to my psychiatrist  he says  ""Why didn't you mention this before?"" To which my response is: I didn't know I should. Translation: I thought it was normal. Right now I'm on Effexor  with Adderall XR as a booster plus synthroid due to a nasty run in with lithium. When I started I was okay. Great even  minus the utter exhaustion at the end of every day. Lately though I've been feeling...things...that I can't describe. Sadness...but a feeling bigger and diverse than the word ""sadness"" can contain. Tired...but a ""tired"" with an emotional component. Feelings I don't have words for  but that pierce me to the bone. And that are not connected with anything in real time that I can think of. Is this normal? Deep strong feelings that surface out of nowhere for a time and then dissipate...usually on the weekends when I don't have work to focus on? Not feeling much of anything in between those times? Being vibrant and full of ideas yet calm and productive first thing after I take the medicines  but gradually fading to sort of numb  definitely tired  somewhat negative by the afternoon with exhausted  sink into the couch with the remote  hit the bed for a nap by 7:30  sometimes 6pm? How do you know what's ""normal"" if abnormal has been normal for you for so long? How do you know when it's time to have a sit down with the psychiatrist again?",1
 I am a 26 year old married mother of three boys. I was recently diagnosed as having depression. I have noticed it getting a lot worse in just the past week. At first I thought to myself I don't have anything to be depressed about but the more I thought about it the more I realized what it was. Me and my husband used to spend time with our kids and go out and do things on Fridays or the weekends. I can't remember the last time we just went to Walmart as a family for no reason other than to go. My husband doesn't understand what the effect of him not spending that time with me and us has had on me. Just like tonight instead of asking me and the boys to run to town with him  his friend went. I don't care if he is only going for an hour that's an hour we could have his time. I cry all the time when he's not here just because I miss my husband. I'm 26 we should have a healthy active life with our kids but instead I work and come home  and on my days off I sit at home with my kids. When he is off he stays at home. He works and then him and his friend if they get off early go places in town and then he comes home. I don't get to do that. I can't remember the last time I just went window shopping  just running around. My thoughts about not being around have gotten worse and that terrifies me. How can I get my husband to understand that him spending time with me would help this so much. He just thinks it's a joke and that's one reason I think he wouldn't miss me if I'm gone except he would have to find another maid.,1
 I have been on antidepressants for probably 10 years now. I was on Serzone which worked very well. My husband and I decided to get pregnant so I had to stop it. I have now been on Zoloft  Effexor and Celexa. I am currently taking 40mg Celexa (generic) and 75 mg Effexor. What I'm wondering is- are hot flashes normal with antidepressants? I don't remember having them on Serzone but I have had them since I started Zoloft. I'm not sure if this is from the medications or pregnancy and nursing? Anyone have experience with this- either medications or pregnancy and breastfeeding? I am 26 by the way,1
 I am 18 years old.  I moved out of my house in with my boyfriend when I was 17.  We had known each other for a year and then started going out.  We bought a place and moved in together two weeks after going out.  We both just wanted to get out of our houses.  Well 2 months later we found out that i was pregnant with our son cameron.  We then had him on christmas day of 2005.  I love my son and i love my fiance  but only being 18 i feel trapped.  My fiance who will be 21 in april also has md (muscular dystrophy).  I have to help take care of him  the house  our 2 month old son  and i work.  Only being 18 i feel so overwhelmed.  My fiance and i have had a lot of problems.  I don't feel like he appreciates me.  When we are alone and the baby is over at a grandparent's house all we do is sit at home watching tv.  He just doesn't understand that i need to get out and do stuff.  We fight constantly about the same thing.  I need romance  I need to feel appreciated  I need to feel that something is about me  and I need the feeling of being loved.  I know my fiance loves me and i love him but how do i get him to understand that i need a life outside of being a fiance and a mother?,1
 Hi all  I'm new - just joined yesterday. I'm a 40-year-old wife and mother of five. I've struggled with depression my whole life - came from an abusive household and inherited some mixed-up genes. I was misdiagnosed last year with bi-polar II and spent a year on mood stabilizers and various other junk that made me a zombie. I'm now on Effexor and just beginning to feel sort of like myself again. I'm a freelance writer and I have a weekly column in our local newspaper. I feel like my creativity has gone to pot and I'm waiting for it to come back. Over the last 18 months I've become pretty reclusive - don't answer the phone  don't get out much  just take care of the basic family needs each day - so I've felt very alone. I stumbled upon this site while doing research on Effexor. I've read a lot of the posts and have felt some hope that this might be helpful to me right now. My husband is worn out  as am I. I just want to be better. I want to be a better mother. I don't want to live my life this way. I've felt like half a person for the last 18 months. I want to be whole again. I'm really struggling with self-esteem and guilt - I worry about what all of this is doing to my family. I hope and pray that my children are strong enough to go through this with me. Anyway  that's me  in a nutshell. I'm glad I found this place.,1
 I was born with mom who has mild autism and in general i have hard times. Since i am her only daughter  i am trying to help her but don't know how?

 i am 29 and a mother of three children ages 11  6  and 2. i have been severely depressed for like my whole life even  when i was in kindergarten i was different i cried all day every day. i have been through so many what i consider to be stages in my depression from like 14 - 17 i suffered from eating disorders and i was a cutter as well then i started having these horrible panic attacks i have spent the good part of the last  10 years dealing with that i have tried many different medication prozac  paxil  buspar and have been on zoloft 50 mg for 2 months it has helped a little but not much i am still horrified to leave my home   scared to be alone   needless to say i have no social life. i just wonder if there really is any hope out there and would love someone to talk to that knows where i am coming from,1
 i need to examine my schedule so i start getting more than three hours of sleep a night. This will not work when school comes around. Next week already. one class  four days a week  five weeks  then I'm done forever. Bloody finally. Goals at hand: get rid of things i don't need/want  save money  clean the car out and wash him  talk to landlord about subleasing  investigate work opportunities  drag the cat tree upstairs  clean apartment. need to start getting rid of things in Wisconsin too. Hoping to make a few weekend trips so i can load up the car and bring stuff back here and take my time going through everything. i feel rushed. Bed now with a book for a few pages.,1
 I don't know what's wrong with me. I have always had depression  and in the past thought of suicide. I got over the suicide idea mostly  but now I'm worried i might have something severe. My dad brought up Multiple sclerosis  and it's worried me ever since. i have a few symptoms of ms  such as fatigue  cognitive problems  and muscle twitches. all the other symptoms i don't really have  and fatigue and cognitive problems can be from depression i believe. well  anyways  i keep getting worried about it  and i started getting scared (anxiety?) and i cant sleep. then right when i just start sleeping  my legs or arms twitch  waking me up abruptly. i would go see a doctor  but i have no medical coverage  and no job.  could this ms idea just be mental  turning into a physical problem with my limbs moving right when i start falling asleep? i do know  when i start falling asleep  i start dreaming then i suddenly move the limb i move in the dream. but also  i don't need to be almost asleep and my arm or leg will move slightly. ,1
 Hi. I'm new  and I'm not really sure where to start in the forums! I've been treated for depression since I was 17 years old  and then misdiagnosed with ADD when I was 17 and that started a downward spiral with abusing Ritalin (snorting about 5-10 times my dosage) for about 5 years. That's over with. I battled with anorexia as a direct result of the Ritalin  and got down to 95 lbs. Then I ballooned up to 185 lbs. I lost 45 lbs. a few years ago and I've kept it off ever since (I've never gone above 144). I've been on Prozac since I was 17  and just recently switched to Cymbalta at the suggestion of my psychiatrist. I felt funny on it  and committed the ultimate sin: I stopped taking my medicines a week ago. I know that's bad. The last two days have been a nightmare  and I even contemplated swallowing a bottle of pills at one point. My fiance is the most amazing person in the world  and I'm literally killing him with my sickness. I don't know what to do. I've been hysterically crying and inconsolable for about a week. Yesterday my fiance called the psychiatrist on-call with our medical program  and she said I needed to take the Cymbalta  so I did take one pill yesterday and again this morning. I do feel weird  though. At the center of it all is my weight gain; I gained about 10ish pounds (I weigh 140 at the moment)  and NONE of my clothes fit me. I feel like a disgusting fat blob all of the time. Just one look in the mirror sets me off and I'm HYSTERICAL for the rest of the day. All I want to do is sleep. SLEEP and never wake up. I've had an eating disorder in the past  and I know I can't fall back into it (the anorexia was a direct result of the Ritalin)  but I am just hysterical  depressed  and I feel disgusting all day long. My clothes don't fit and I feel fat and disgusting and horrible and I want to cry and rip out my hair. I'm thinking this weight has a LOT to do with my recent downward turn in my depression  but I just can't lose the weight. I work out constantly and follow a really healthy/strict eating plan  and nothing is working. I'm just reaching the end of my rope  here. And to top it all off: I'm getting married next month. I need help...I've called my psychiatrist  but I don't know what to do. I don't see a psychologist; I think I need to  but I've had bad experiences in the past. I think I just need help and guidance and a way to lose this weight and feel good about myself. Hoping this forum will help.,1
 I'm not exactly sure what the topic is (kind of vague)  but for me: Depression started around the age of 11 (I'm almost 23 now)  one summer I was sitting in my room  laying on my bed  listening to music  and gazing out the window  and it kind of hit me like a ton of bricks. I just felt like I didn't even exist.  Like the world outside my window didn't exist. Like the sun would never shine again.  Like life itself was pointless. I tried to talk to my mom about it  but she obviously didn't understand what I was saying to her  she told me I needed to do more work around the house to keep myself busy... look at me now...,1
" I'm brand-new here at these forums. I've come to you all to seek guidance/wisdom from any of you who has suffered or is currently suffering from depression. Within the past 3 years I have struggled on and off with this disease. For the most part I've had it under control  until relatively recently. About four months ago I was drastically descending downwards mental health wise. The result of this declination helped obstruct all aspects of my social life  causing an abrupt  painful end to many friendships I endeared. Also my negative behavior started to poison. The equilibrium that my family and I shared. The result of all this lead not only to my choice of isolation   but even if I chose not to isolate myself  I still had damaged relationships so much  that any attempts to make amends  and or repair former friendships  were futile. I basically pushed and alienated myself from everything I held dearest. Anyways  one day I just snapped; my ability to process information  perform simple math equations  remember things I had JUST thought of seconds before  concentrate  quick wit  and confident decision making had all been impaired immensely. Previously  before all of this  I was an ""A"" Honor Role student and had no difficulty functioning efficiently in my ""AP"" classes  but now I can barely sustain a low ""B"" average. Has anyone experienced this lack of cognition? If so  do you know if it will go away? Its driving me insane!",1
 just wondering  if there is anyone out there at this time  how do you stop yourself from self - harming when the going gets so tough you start to disassociate? I have been taking my absolute limit of PRN medication  but feel like if I phone a helpline it is all going to be too trivial. My home support nurse has told me I need to stop taking the PRN meds NOW but i've tried and I can't. The urge is so great I can nearly guarantee that by the time I get to bed I will have hurt myself again. PLEASE tell me what helps you in this situation ...,1
 I bet you think this post is about you. What do you know? I'm back! And  if you're reading this  you're back as well. Glad to see you again. Looking' good  kiddo! Yeah  I know. I'm a prick for not posting for so long. But  lately ... okay not lately. Basically  I just recently realized some worthless pathetic 'friend' of mine has been doing nothing but screwing me over since I've known them. Don't you hate that? Yeah  so unfortunately  this has taken up a lot of my energy. That  and I'm poor. And some asshole sideswiped my car in the middle of the night and took out my antenna and side mirror  not to mention fucking up my door and windshield. As you may have already guessed  I've been a ray of fucking sunshine as of late. The hate-o-meter is flashing red and this god damn alarm thing won't stop blaring  and the neighbor's dog won't stop fucking barking. SHUT THAT DOG UP! SHUT THAT DOG UP! But anyway  those are my excuses. Not good excuses  mind you  but it's all I've got. Donations are accepted but not required. I hope the four-twenty holiday went well for all of you good-for-nothing potheads. I myself had a smashing holiday when some of that sweet vegetation unexpectedly came into my life. It was ... alright. Not of spectacular quality. Crap. Eh  did any other holidays pass since I last wrote? Easter  maybe? I believe once again I was drunk on Easter. Mother's Day is coming up pretty damn fast  however. Shit  well mom  I hope you appreciate handmade cards like you did when I was five. Fuck  where's that glue stick? And WHY DON'T WE HAVE ANY GLITTER??? Oh  well. See  this is why we need to be rid of holidays where I either don't get a day off and slash or holidays where I have to buy slash do stuff or suffer the consequence of feeling guilt. Don't I have enough guilt already? Sorry the funny is lacking  kiddies. It's hard to be funny when you want to beat someone's head in with a tire iron covered in bloody feces while Pantera screams in the background. I would've also accepted Slayer. Or Wham. I'll post again when I stop feeling homicidal. okay less homicidal.,1
 my name here is mystry and on behalf of me  myself and I ... we all would like to say hey ... but I see we already have ... so let's say hello ... duh ... we've said that too ... gosh gall darn it ...

I guess you've noticed that I hide my fear and pain behind a mask of humor ... but as I write this I am crying like a little baby ... and this baby is a 46 year old ... male ... from Canada ... I hope to find a hiding spot here and maybe some support ... hopefully my years will bring some knowledge to a few here as well ... I guess I will stumble out the way I came in ...,1
 Hi. My name is Jenna. I'm 20 years old and just joined and figured that I should introduce myself. I found this site from searching online and think that it's great. I only started accepting the fact that I've been depressed last year because I've always been very good at hiding it from everyone else and I used to fool myself as well (if that makes sense). I've never been one to seek help from others because in the past I've always dealt with everything myself. The start of college and being outside (different state) of my home environment (which is the cause of a lot of anger and resentment that I also have) helped me to see that there was something wrong with the way that I was living and that I could reach out and get help. I'm currently seeing a counselor (through my college and since I feel like I'm working well with her that I don't need to seek other outside help yet) about my anxiety and depression but I feel that talking to others that are going through the same thing could help give me a different view on everything and be helpful as well. I'm glad that I stumbled across these forums and I can't wait to get to know some of you. Jenna,1
 when i was really young my sister who is like 5 years older than me got me to constantly play these role playing games with her where she was the dominant one in the relationship it went on until i was in 6th grade i think i don't know and the thing is  I'm not repulsed by her or anything. i don't hate her. i didn't know at the time it was wrong but even though i do now ... i don't really know my feelings about it but i think it's one of the reasons I'm depressed. i haven't been able to tell anyone about it. not even my psychiatrist. i wish i could but every time i get close i close up and get really anxious i wish i could get this off my chest. i don't know if my mom knows or not. we don't talk about anything  and to add to this  i think i might be gay and i don't know if it was because of this or not it  it started when i was 12 but i didn't recognize it as homosexuality. I've only been with two girls while in middle school but that's it.  i think some guys are cute and all but i just get really uncomfortable. my psychiatrist thinks i have some repressed memory   but i don't know what to do about it. i always clog up whenever i want to tell someone something important  i have this fear that they wont care or will tell someone else. my family has a huge problem with that and I've known too many deceitful people to trust anyone  so if you have any ideas to what i should do please tell me,1
" I'm a 24 year old female and I am extremely ugly.  Despite having tried a slew of products recommended by dermatologists  and washing religiously  I nonetheless I have the most disgusting skin ever (EVER.  You know Freddy Kreuger?  He suddenly starts to look quite appealing next to me).  And I have ... unfortunate features.  I have a nose that would shame Pinocchio  small eyes  and a manly jaw.  This never used to bother me too much  because I've lived with being Unfortunate Looking my whole life  heard all the insults in school  and I figured that anyone who didn't want to know me because of my appearance wasn't worth my time.  I try to make the best of what I've got - I'm not especially clever or talented in anything  but at least I dress nicely  get my hair done  wear makeup and all that  and I try to enjoy myself.  I knew I was unattractive  but I hoped that people enjoyed my company  and that one day I might even charm someone with my lovely personality enough that he might want to date me despite my appearance (it hasn't happened yet  but you've got to tell yourself SOMETHING  right?).  I have lots of friends  and even though I'm forever boyfriend -less  I'm the one that people seem to depend on for everything but sex  and that has always been a comfort to me.  But yesterday  I overheard a friend - a friend! - saying that my skin is ""disgusting"" and I ought to ""do something"" about it.  He said that it was no wonder I was single.  He said it was a ""shame I wanted children so much  since no one would ever want to get close enough to impregnate me"".  The person he was talking to suggested IVF.   I don't think I will ever be happy again.  I want to cut my face off.  I want to cut my face off and stick a grenade in my mouth. I don't want anyone to ever  ever look at me again.   I can't believe how utterly worthless I feel.  It's not just that they think I'm ugly - that's hurtful  but I knew I was hardly God's Gift to Men.  But that they would speak about me like that behind my back ... use THAT word in connection with ME?! ... I can't believe how much I've been kidding myself!!  The message is loud and clear: if you're ugly  you're not worth respect or friendship or love. ",1
" First of all  a happy Christmas to one and all. My situation is that I have had moderate depression on and off since 18 years old  and 2 years ago aged 33 I had it so bad I had to be off work for 3 months. Then I tried the SSRI Escitalopram and it worked perfectly and I went back to work. I came off it a year ago and then 4 months ago I suffered a relapse and had to go back on it  and now I am OK (except when it came back for 3 days after a booze bender). My psychiatrist is saying I should take them indefinitely. As I have no side effects I am happy with this  but I am concerned about some reports saying that they start to work less well after some years. Is this right. And if so wouldn't it be better to ration them so I only take them after I relapse? So they keep on working for longer  if not the rest of my life. Is there anyone on the boards here who has been taking antidepressants for many years who has found they have become less effective and now regrets having taken them for that reason. And now suffers depression that now cannot be treated by medication? Yes I've heard that you can switch to others  but surely the same type of reasoning applies? The psychiatrist said that I had endogenous depression with a reactive cause  and that she didn't think that counseling would help. Does this make sense? A former work colleague of mine recently said that the antidepressants had made me start acting ""weird"". Well apart from posting on an internet forum I don't think I've done anything weird  and other friends agree with me. But other friends all think that it is not good for you to keep taking these ""happy pills"" for a long term  that antidepressants are a short term fix only. But what do they know. You can't really tell if others have depression from the outside. Neil (35 years young  from the UK) ",1
 Well  it is nearly time. I swore to myself that I will not be dealing with depression by the time I will be 40. Shit  my 39th is toddling along shortly  so I will have only one more year to keep my promise.  Gee  no idea whether I be able to make it  but I swore to myself that I have to have the darn depression stuff under my wings by then.  So  keep your fingers crossed for me. The clock is ticking ..   PS: heh  heh  just thought  since I LOOK nearly 80 presently  maybe I could get a bonus day or two of extension  because of the depressing reflection in mirrors. What do you think? ,1
"   I just turned 18 and a couple of months have gone by and everything is a mess. I feel so paranoid about everything; that I'm going to die. That every feeling ache or pain is something horrible. Sometimes I just feel like I might have a heart attack and die and I'm just so afraid! I can't sleep alone at night anymore. I feel week and helpless and I hate it. I feel selfish that I'm so worried about myself. Everything has just hit me so hard and I don't know why  and although I've seen doctors and she told me ""oh I'm too young to be feeling this way  too young to take medicine"" I just cant shake it. I'll be seeing a psychiatrist soon too  all my loved ones give me constant reassurance  but I just cant push all these horrible things out of my head. I don't want to cry anymore or feel like this I just want to feel like myself again ...   ... I'm just looking for someone who understands. Has anyone been through this  these feelings? How do you cope?? Argh ... well... I'm sorry but thank you for your time and patience ... I'm new to this forum .. in fact my first forum post ever written  just hope I can find a little advice ...

" I am 30 years old and have lived with depression/dysthymia my whole life. I am going on one year of marriage to the most wonderful man ever. I've always wanted children until recently. I'm going through yet another depressive spell where I can barely function and come home after a high-powered job with headaches and complete mental exhaustion. I barely have enough for me  and even less for my husband! How could I handle a baby? It's pretty much inevitable I will have post-partum. When I thought about adoption I realized that I'd still be primary caretaker for a child and what if I can't be ""there"" for the child? I am SO ANGRY that this ""condition"" hinders so much in my life. Anyone else struggle with this?",1
 Hi everyone I am new here. I guess I will start from the top with my story. At the age of 17 I was hospitalized for bipolar disorder which I do not think I have. Anyways I was hospitalized twice medicines worked for a while but then I would just crash down into a further depression. At the age of 18 I stopped all medicines because I was happy and didn't think they were really doing anything to help me. Since that time I still suffer occasional bouts of depression. I will also add in that my mom has schizoaffective disorder and that I have many aunts and uncles with depression. I am now soon to be 26 and I just feel very alone. I am married and I work and go to school right now. I am just overwhelmed I don't want to go to my classes I don't feel like it is worth my time I feel like no one cares if I succeed or fail. I have had these feelings before this is the same way I felt when I dropped out of high school. I just feel worthless the only thing I even enjoy anymore is work and lately that has not given me much enjoyment at all I use to be eager to be there and now I am anxious to get off of work and come home and not do anything. My husband and I have been fighting a lot lately he has an anger problem that we have been trying to work through  and it is negatively impacting the way I feel. I can also tell though that he is worried about me he keeps asking me if I am ok or if I am mad at him I just don't really feel anything right now I am just numb. I just have a million thoughts running through my head and no matter what I do I can't seem to get rid of the negativity. I am tired all the time  yet I can't sleep at night that well but I have been falling asleep in the middle of the afternoons. I overreact to little things and the list goes on. I know what can happen if I let this go on. I nearly lost my life to the negative thoughts when I was younger that is the only reason I got help then. I have decided to see my doctor and get some help I just think I need some support I have no friends around here well at least that have any time to visit and my family is all 2 hours away. ,1
 I can really relate to what a lot of you have said  in being embarrassed about seeking help. Being a teenager I don't have really have the ability to seek help on my own  and there is no way that I'm going to tell my parents. I tried hinting at it - telling them I didn't care about stuff  that I hated being around people. I even tried making it completely obvious in giving up or ignoring things I'm usually interested in  such as getting my driver's license (I'm 16  I'll get it soon). Unfortunately  she's a complete idiot and just passes everything off as being normal  somehow. Hell  once I told her flat out that I thought that 'life sucks ' and she still didn't get it! How stupid can you be?  Much of the time I feel like the biggest idiot on the face of the earth  but not even I am that dense.,1
 I have never had dreams that I can remember  before I started treatment for depression.  Oh sure  everyone once in a while  I would wake up and know that I was in the middle of a dream when I woke  but I know at times I could go for weeks on end and never feel as if I had dreamt or if I had  I couldn't remember.  I also know or have been told  we all dream every night  it's a fact  we just don't remember them.   Since I have been taking medication for depression (Effexor and Klonopin)  I dream every night!  And not just one  several dreams.  They are very vivid  most of them don't make any sense but some of them do.  It just amazes me how much I dream now and the things I dream about and can remember!  Has anyone experienced this and can it be related to the medications? ,1
" I'm new here - wasn't quite sure where to start but ""special new member posting area"" seemed appropriate. I think I've been battling depression off and on for some time now. I saw a therapist briefly  for a couple months  but had to stop when it got too expensive and when I couldn't take the time off work anymore. I actually didn't even start seeing her until the worst of my depression had already passed. Not sure I got that much out of it  but maybe I didn't give it enough time. I was doing so well for a while  but in the last week or two  I can feel myself sliding back into it. There are certain things  issues  that tend to pull me into that hole. I'd done so well at avoiding them  I felt like I was over it. But I'm dwelling on them again  and I don't know what to do this time to break the hold. The smallest thing sets me off crying  and I've completely lost interest in the things I was so excited about two weeks ago  along with most everything else. I feel completely isolated - I have no one to talk to about this  which I guess is why I'm here online. OK not sure what the point of this post was  but thanks for letting me get it out. Sometimes it feels better just to tell someone  anyone.",1
 Hi  I'm 19 and new here. I've suffered from acute depression for getting on for 18 months now. I currently take Citalopram  having tried Fluoxetine but it wasn't doing much good for me. I self-harmed on-and-off from the age of 16 to 18 and have been stopped since last June. I recently became engaged (on Boxing Day!) and last month emigrated to live with my fiance. I have previously received some CBT for depression and OCD but that stopped when I went to university in Sept 2005. My mental health deteriorated drastically whilst at university and in December I made the decision to leave. I am hoping that I will soon be able to get some counseling or other sort of psychological therapy here  and to start coming off my medication at some point soon  although I don't want to rush that as I don't want a relapse.,1
 I am looking for someone to help me to understand if the way i feel is normal growing up or am i depressed?  It feels like my life is stuck in park and i really want it to start driving again  like i had always planned it would.  You see i'll be 28 soon and i still live at home with my mom (we get along great and she's my best friend) but i just can't afford to live on my own yet.  Fort Lauderdale is quite expensive ..... i just laid off from my job a month ago and have been working with my mom to make some money so i don't have to dip into savings  my boyfriend of almost 10 months is too busy for me it seems and i just feel like i am stuck ... he is the one for me  but i'm not sure he feels the same for me .... i've always wanted to get married and have the kids  but it looks like that will never happen and i feel so hopeless ....     not sure how these chat things work  so hopefully someone will read this and want to talk or just tell me this is normal feeling .... ,1
 I had really bad anxiety attacks/panic attacks when I am on the first couple days of my period. I mean bad... to the point of having to stay home from school for 2-3 days. I would be in so much pain and extremely depressed and so many other symptoms. I found that when I got on birth control... around 5 months on it  they stopped being so horrible. I do still have to watch my diet around the time though... my blood sugar gets extremely low and I pass out and shake a lot. I'd say maybe talk to your doctor about birth control... it was a lifesaver for me. I just wanted to rip my danged uterus out!,1
 I really wanted to go to the chat room today. but I'm at work and I don't think these computers allow it. I just really need someone to talk to. I am so sick of being this unsatisfied brat I just got a new job doing what i went to school for  and I hate it.  I feel like such a fake .. so pointless. i feel like no matter what i do it doesn't matter I am always going to be unhappy like the grass is always going to be greener where I am not.  I've taken personality tests and they say this is my personality. i don't want this personality. i want to be happy like other people.  well i say other people  but to be honest i don't know anyone that i would consider happy. everyone just seems to go on with life just kind of doing what they're supposed to i think happiness is a lie.  the only people i know that seem to be okay are alcoholics and druggies.  so you know they're not really ok. lately i've just been trying to fill the huge empty hole that my life is.  it's such a load of crap.  my husband says he loves life but he can't go one day without smoking stuff or drinking a 6 pack and i just want to scream at him LIAR.  and he tells to appreciate it because one day its going to end.  and you know what   i know he's right  but i find myself thinking that that would be such a weight off my shoulders no pain no worries no hassles no nothing. just over.  just done with all this stupid bullshit and the lies. somewhere i learned that life is supposed to be easy once you reach a certain point or succeed at certain things.  but that is so wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!! life will never be easy i will always be dealing with this crap and that makes me so sad and so wishing i were dead.,1
 I guess I am writing because I don't know how to think or feel at this period. I feel that I have hurt a lot of people by having my depression  especially my parents. I haven't phoned them in 2 weeks  I just don't have the courage to talk to them. I guess they feel that I blame them for my condition. Same with my remaining 2 sisters. Dang what a situation I have put myself in!  I still have a group of friends that like me a lot  but I haven't told them about suffering from depression. I hide it inside and either act in anxious way or I do solitary activities such as write poems  play the piano or swim.  I guess the main embuggerance is that I finding the third year of my course a real struggle at the best of times  but having understanding tutors and talking to doctors that have depression help.  I don't know why things have turned out the way things are  why I struggle with anything remotely challenging  but I guess that will never be explained. Sometimes i feel frustrated with the way things have turned and I can do very little to change the current of of my present situation.  I feel kind of sick with stuff at the moment. Not that I am assuming a victim complex  but just that in all the poems I write about  I always seek a sanctuary from the business aspect of life  you know the dog eat dog  go compete with others to get a job and survive for the next 55 years of my projected lifespan. Yeah pretty heady thoughts I'm having!  I guess I'm just scared of the future. I don't know how to survive  I kind of want to blank the future out. I guess all in all  I want to live a simple life and be decent to others. I would like the people I meet in the future to say hey that Haymond guy was a splendid fellow who really loved people and would go out of his way to help them  because he could.   But than an inner anxiety knows that I have hurt people from withdrawing into myself and by depression's virtue being too self indulgent. That hurts the most  knowing I hurt people from my depression. I never intended to harm anyone or be this way. If I could smile and be happy I would  but I can only show the scars of my mental pain as a testament to self torment.  Don't get me wrong  I smile sometimes and even rejoice in the company of those friends in normal health  but I guess I feel rejected. Self rejection and by that of the stigma of the people of the same age I encounter on campus and at home.  I want this to stop I guess. I want a placebo pill that will transport me to the Elysium fields  because sometimes reality is a bugger to experience. I guess the main message is that I want respite from this life  some form of relief and rest  where I will achieve or obtain this elusive elixir of peace. But I'm here  still standing  still finding a lot of life a challenge  still merging into a crowd of people who are too proud to admit that sometimes things may be too much.  Who am I and what am I doing here ... I haven't a faintest clue. Yeah  I'm scared of defeat  of a battered ego that even a shred of self esteem that I had will be allowed to fly in the fresh wind.  Its sounds like I'm asking for love ... I guess I am. Also that I would love some help  and in no small measure I have requested that help from doctors and therapists and talked to you my dear friends. But I find it extremely hard to help myself  to make amends with the very mind that hurts me so.  I don't know what to think is what I wrote at the top of the blog  now seems apt to include it in the conclusion. I guess spilling my emotions has made me feel somewhat dizzy!  I guess I will wander  spinning round in circles until I get what the whole dang thing of life is all about. ,1
 Driving back home from dropping my cousins off  I began to think about my future actions. I'm fully committed to this. I know that when I start  there's no going back. If I don't succeed  if this becomes a botched suicide attempt  there really will be no life after that. My parents will hate me. My friends will leave me or treat me with kid gloves. Either way  I suffer even more than I suffer now. It doesn't seem possible that my suffering can grow but I know that if I don't continue or succeed  it will. I honest to goodness don't know what's wrong with me. I mean  why do I have to feel like this? Nothing I've done to make things right with myself has helped. Things just keep getting worse for me. Before  I let it go because I understood that the bad needs to happen before the good. That you have to have the bad with the good. I kept on waiting for the good. I didn't expect sunshine and rainbows but I expected some sort of light  even a tiny bit. I expected a slight reprieve from the evil  dark thoughts swirling in my mind. No. Everything just seemed to worsen with time  with me. They say that time heals all wounds but time has just worsened mine.,1
" Here's my answer to your age question. Sadly  I am 29 years old: sniffle1: Don't get me wrong. I don't want to be completely alone for the rest of my life. There's a sentimental part of me that yearns for companionship with a guy  but I have such a tall hurdle to overcome before I can even get to that yet. Yeah  but I can relate to the peace and quiet thing by myself. It really is such a luxury nowadays (personally speaking). One thing I reflected on was that I live in a family of 8 people  and maybe that's why I feel so claustrophobic and irritable around lots of people. Essentially  there's no secure privacy  really. Yup  like you I used to live independently when I went to school. I'm on a bit of a break right now  but will go back in September where I'll share an apartment with a roommate I don't know. Right now  I'm mooching off my parents' food and shelter. At age 29  I feel like a little child. And by the way  I'm unemployed too. I tried all summer to land a job  but in vain. I only worked one day for Elections Canada  and that was it. Oh well  a paycheck is a paycheck  right? The thing is  I can't stand living with somebody I hardly know either. Sometimes I just don't want to greet somebody at breakfast  or say a polite 'hello  how are you  or how was your day?"". When I battle depression and social anxiety  I really really need the comfort of familiar people around me at times. The last thing I need is a complete stranger sharing my quarters. But  it's something I can't help. I'll probably isolate myself in my room for a while. At least I get cable TV and the internet. Then again  I'll probably become a complete hermit during the school year.",1
 I have no idea where to start so I am going to begin at the beginning.  I have somehow managed to hit rock bottom again as far as emotions go.   I should be happy. I am about to graduate from school  ok so I am middle aged and overweight  but hey I am in school ..... again.  I should be happy  I have over 12 years of sobriety  i am a certified health care provider  and I have a teen daughter most people don't think is possible to have  we still like to spend time with each other ... apparently this is a lost art for teens and parents  I am utterly convinced that everyone of my classmates is afraid of me and they all want me gone  I am unable to look myself in the face without wanting to vomit  I feel afraid  hopeless  lost  every time I get close to achieving a goal I have worked hard for I go into this self destruct mode  I do my level best to sabotage myself  like now I should be working on a resume  a cover letter  and a portfolio as well as studying for a very hard test  but here I am on the computer trying to figure out if I am a whiner or in deep trouble  the thing that made me sit down and write was the thought that crossed my mind on the way home. I thought how much better my daughter's life would be without me around  she could go live with my sister and never have to worry about money or a roof over her head or being able to have a good prom night  she could be happy and never have to worry about me again  my roommate would be better off  so would my family  I am not even sure at this moment if I am serious about wanting to be done with it all or if it is my sabotage mode  this is so stupid  I was abused for most of my life. you can think of it it was probably done to me and now there is no one to abuse me but me  I am picking up where they left off  Stupid ... no?  and to top it off my email is about to be cut off because it's pay that or feed the kid  so if anyone wants to reply to me they can email me at xxxxx  I am using a friend's email for the next month  I feel dumb doing THIS  but I am really freaked here and could use an ear or two to bend ,1
 I'm having a problem with my depression. You see  I'm taking more medicine. I'm taking Welbrutrin (150mg) on top of my Zoloft (100mg). I've been out of work for over 5 months. And it is now SERIOUSLY making me crazy. I need to talk with people  but I don't know how. I need to find a job  but I don't know how. I am a good guy. In fact I am THE good guy. All of the people who have had me to work for them have loved me. I get promotions all of the time. It's getting in the door that seems to be the problems. And I have a family to take care of. My wife started working  but it won't be enough to pay the rent. This is so hard for me. I am of the old school. I believe in chivalry  the man taking care of his family. Except that I feel like I'm being less of a man. I am broken. I don't know what to do. I can see myself being suicidal  but not in the sense of killing myself  but for looking for someone to help me. God I've never been in such trouble. And I don't feel loved. It's not my wife  it's not my son. But I think that not working for so long  and the fact that I don't have friends  makes me need contact with people. Any people. I just don't know how to do that.,1
 I will be on the road in less than 72 hours. The last month has taken a serious toll on me physically  cognitively  emotionally  and spiritually. Things have suddenly gotten so crazy. Nothing looks even remotely familiar to me (Aggers  2002). I have held My Sweetie with tears in my eyes  hoping her to buoy my hope for the future. I have been overwhelmed by the enormity of change and possibility  fallen to my knees  bowed my head beneath our roof  and prayed in earnest that it will not be the last. I have wrestled with the stranglehold of others' denial  silently observing time crush their last defense as the flurry of last-minute demands  requests  and desires are left unfulfilled. I have ended my beloved employment  said goodbye to supervisors and peers  returned keys  cleaned out my desk  and stood at the door of my empty office with the first true inkling of the magnitude of what has become the most difficult life transition I have yet faced.,1
" Hi I am trying to get a grip back on my life. My mental health has cost me my marriage. My husband just couldn't handle it anymore. I was hospitalized five times in April and May for suicidal attempt and thoughts. He was there every day for me but felt abandoned by me. As he said through tears ""he couldn't save me"". After the hospitalizations I was really needy. He married a strong and independent woman. In Sept I took myself off my medicines and went into a rage and accused him of cheating on me. That broke his heart and his spirit...he left. Of course  I went into a tailspin. Finally got of the couch last weekend  three months later. I stopped my counseling and medicines. I know I have to get it back together again. I guess looking for support here is a step in the right direction. I am trying to figure out how to go on when you lost the best thing that ever happened to you. Thanks for listening",1
 I am new to this so please bear with me.  I don't even know where to begin.  With all of   the tragedy going on in our gulf coast as well as the war  I feel I have no right to be   unhappy but I am 24 / 7.  I am 37 years old and have made a complete mess of my life.  My parents were raised in   Europe and came to the states in their 20's.  I have a younger brother who also has   depression but it differs from my own.  When I look back at my childhood all I feel is   pain and neglect and I can't recall any happy memories.  I don't believe that I was ever   physically abused however  I do think that I was ignored and emotionally neglected.    Perhaps that is why I manage to make a mess of my life every time things seem to be going   well.  I'm married and have a 4 year old son.  From all outward appearances  my life comes   across as perfect (although we all know there is no such thing).  I have been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since I was 17 and have tried to commit   suicide on four separate occasions.  My mother suffers from depression and her mother did   as well.  This is such a long and complicated story and I don't know how much I am allowed   to write or if anyone is even interested since this is my first try in any type of chat   room.  My interior pain lies so far deep that I don't sleep  hardly eat and feel miserable   all the time.  I guess that is all I will say for now. ,1
 Well  I have to admit that as a male I've always viewed my own depression as personal weakness. I still do  I can't help it ...it's a notion  feeling or philosophy or whatever that's been instilled from an early age. I know this is not a popular or realistic way to feel about depression. I mean  it's an illness  right. I've never been to a doctor to have my condition properly diagnosed or treated. At the moment  I really can't face my doctor with that sort of issue (btw  I'm in my mid-40s and I've suffered from depression since as long as i can remember) - I've learned to cope  in a fashion  but probably at the expense of a reasonable sense of social 'normality'- i.e. divorced  emotionally empty relationships  enormous amounts of time spent alone  dissatisfied working life  etc. One covers up & disguises the depression at work  at home  and wherever/whenever necessary...and then  when you're all alone  the demons can come out to play(or even before you're alone) - but at least you maintain the expected external masculine dignity  most of the time. For example  today my son wanted to come over to visit me but because I've been feeling so miserable and morbid and soaked in ennui this week  I made an excuse to put off his visit because I didn't want him to see me feeling low & depressed(and weak) and thus ruining his day/week. Instead  I went out on a freezing 10 mile walk alone to try to physically squash the depression. This is a regular occurrence - I get depressed  I hate myself for being weak  so I do something physical to try to alleviate the symptoms(and also to punish myself for feeling depressed)... it works...temporarily. In my mind  this sort of masochism is (or has been)preferable to taking alcohol  drugs (even prescribed medicines)  fags  therapy or inflicting real self-harm and so forth because  at least  it keeps me feeling physically fit-physically balanced(and I guess that's important to me) even if it's not always an effective cure for one's depression. And I can keep up the public pretence that all is well. Sorry  back to the point - yes  it seems a lot of men do tend to suffer depression in silence (one wonders what the real percentage could be!).When I joined this group yesterday it was the first time I'd openly voiced the notion that I DO suffer from depression. Not so macho. Perhaps my condition is getting worse... or maybe I'm just feeling a little more realistic about what it is to be a male suffering from depression. Are there MANY women (or even men) out there who are truly sympathetic to males who suffer from depression? Unfortunately  I haven't seen much evidence out there so far?,1
 I have had depression for at least 5 years now. I have been with my partner for 2 years and in that time i have come to depend on him for a lot of things - everyday things like making phone calls for me etc. because i find it too hard. In the last couple of months  friends / family have seen him out with another girl  they were closer than they should've been  i have also seen it with my own eyes. Since i have noticed this  our relationship has deteriorated a lot  to the point that we are fighting every weekend  and during the week because he is always wanting to go to his friends house (who is this girl's brother). Today  he has been really angry and agro at me. He has told me to go away and that he has been avoiding me on purpose. I feel like if we broke up my life would be ruined. I feel like i need him to survive. Every time we have come close to breaking up  it ends up me begging him not to leave. We live together which makes things harder. I have no friends left because i was so dependant on him and they got sick of me not seeing them. It's easy to say break up with him  but if you understood how attached i am you would know its not so easy. I don't know what to do. I think he is cheating on me but i need him ... does anyone have any advice? I am lost ... I don't know what to do anymore.,1
 I went to this meeting. It was for people who have depression. The leader said to me that I was so knowledgeable I should be well. I was very sick at the time.  Which went to show me I had knowledge but no wisdom. For years I knew this. I read all the books and nothing changed. I really felt like maybe I was on the wrong line of thought to get over the depression. Yet I did feel better. I thought my life isn't changing though.  I have so many hopes and dreams for my life and here I am sitting around wasting it. I still feel like that at times but then something bad happened and I didn't react to it. I didn't feel worse. Then someone did something stupid and I didn't yell at them. I went to a friend and asked if she thought I was getting better. Her answer was. Hell Yeah. You bother to talk to me now. It seems she was doing all the talking at one stage. I didn't know.  It's been 10 years since I first got depressed In all the tests on the computer it went from severe depression to moderate the other day I got mild depression. Ok today its back to moderate. I think the reason for this is that I'm nearly there with a thought process and I just can't get it. I'm kicking myself for it for being incompetent and those words from that woman came back you have all this knowledge you should be better. Do I need to go back and do some stuff on self esteem again? Is this what this is about. I look inside of me and see my self esteem has fallen apart again ......... and I mean again! How many times is this? 100? a 1000 times?  Why can't I work this out? I don't know what is wrong.  I think if she asked me now  I would tell her  I haven't got all the answers yet. Somehow I wished she was right. That with what I knew I could just be better.  I'm off to hit the books. :-/ Isn't depression ironic? You can feel bad about anything even a compliment.  By the way. I'm still procrastinating. It's better though. I think. Not that much though I have so much to do. OK that is wrong isn't it?  I'm heading to the quiet of my bedroom to study. I hope.   ,1
 The base is 3 bound boxes of Remerol tablets (similar to Effexor). Above that is my trusty 300 mg slow release wellbutrin. Next  Sonata for occasional use; and then onto concerta per my request. Finally there is Risperdal and Topemax - a headache medication.  I tried to kill myself last spring and came very  very close. This event has opened up spiritual dimensions more terrible than I thought possible. Forgive me for sounding weird  but with my life just one little hop  one small step away from obliteration  the return back became a long journey. And most of me didn't even make it back - after the attempt I was hospitalized on a ward with a sociopath as my neighbor. I was naive and even befriended him. Far too late in the relationship I realized that this person may not have my best interests in hand. So I left the hospital but I left beaten. Then I went home to my family and some of them reacted terribly against my illness. I felt powerless  like I was spreading some miserable disease. My struggle goes on but at least I am alive. I believe in many things I never used to now  and that gives me hope.  To anyone reading this  I just hope you won't toy with your life. Live a long one  it's important you do. ,1
" I was sexually  physically  and emotionally abused by my father  my uncle and my grandparents from the time I was five until I was fifteen. My mother had taken my father and his family to court for it but everyone said that she made me say it to get back at my father  since I was ""only five"" and ""not old enough to know anything."" None of them were punished for it and I had to keep seeing them on visitations until I was sixteen (i'm still sixteen) and I told my dad I didn't want to see him anymore. This obviously did not make him happy and he knows it is about the abuse. Every once and awhile he emails me or calls and tries to make me feel guilty about it and when he does I get upset all over again just when I had started to seem to get better. I really wanted to write a book about my life  but I figured that because my dad and his family wasn't punished or proven guilty that I'd be sued for it. I want to change my last name and then get a pen name  but my mom says I have to wait until I am eighteen. I don't exactly want to wait that long to write my book  but I feel like I don't have a choice. I've considered taking them back to court but I figured it's probably hopeless and I feel guilty and doubtful even though I know it happened. Anyways  I don't want to put my mom through all that again. A lot of times I think that I imagined it all and deny it because I wish it didn't happen. I really want to be a writer and to help people who've been abused  but without proving my abusers guilty I feel as if this is impossible  that it isn't my right. I'm scared they'd be found innocent and then try to kill me for taking them to court. What should I do? I know everyone here is having a hard time and I really don't mean to be a bother. I feel guilty just talking about it because there are so many others who've had the same thing happen to them but I really needed advice.",1
 Hi everybody. New member have been lurking for a while thought I would introduce myself. My name is Phil  have had depression all my life or as far back as I can recall. Why is it so hard to admit to yourself that you even have it? Any way I have been looking on internet for some info and come across this site which looks very friendly and inviting. I am taking citalopram at present and waiting to see a psychologist but she says I am not ready for her help which is very frustrating she says I wouldn't be able to function if she started therapy with me.  I work full time so I guess it is for the best. I am beginning to understand about depression a bit more now it would be nice to here from anybody out there who has suffered from depression and have found practical ways to deal with it. How do you get out of the dark hole  how do you feel like you are partaking in life and not just spectating. Anyway nice to know I am not the only one I do not feel so much of an alien now. Bye 4 now Phil.,1
" Hi everyone. I am a 26 yrold mom of three  6 and under. My depression started as a teenager  but somehow back then I was able to ""talk myself out of it"" and perhaps had enough going on to keep me distracted. I got married right after high school  and nine months later  (overnight  really) became a mom. I never intended to be a mom at nineteen. I had dreamed of going to college  enjoying years of freedom with my husband  and then  carefully ""planning"" our first child. Well  seven years later  we've planned only one (our last)  and strangely enough my only planned child was the hardest to recover from emotionally. After the birth of my first child I struggled with denial over all my crushed dreams  and fought back depression and suicide on a daily basis. I saw a psychiatrist who put me on various medicines over the next few months  to no significant improvement. When my daughter was three months old I was voluntarily committed to a behavioral health facility and stayed there four days. I came out fully charged  and within a matter of days  was right back where I started. So I started seeing a therapist who did me little good  and continued on the latest medicine combination I was prescribed. Shortly after my daughter turned one I finally gave up on the medicines and the therapy and pretended to be better  even though I wasn't  because of the sheer frustration that nothing was ""helping"" so I might as well just get on with life. I continued to battle depression and suicide on a daily basis  and also struggled with behavior that was contrary to what a good mother should be. My husband was military  and it is during times in his absence that I have become ""her""  my alter ego  someone who is intolerant  impatient  selfish  and ugly towards my kids. And blah  blah  blah. Do you guys get tired of telling your life story  because I do. I've lost count of how many times I've told it to various therapists in some vain attempt to help them understand me. So let me tell you where I am now. I am a person who is deeply confused. On the one hand I dearly love my kids  my husband  and I have the desire to live life and see my children grow and strengthen my relationship with them and my husband. On the other hand  I am sapped of every last ounce of purpose  life becomes extremely monotonous  and I strain to see the point of it all. Even now  as I write this  I am wondering  ""why am I wasting my time? These people will never know one tenth of a percent of what is going on inside me."" And that is how I've left every therapy session I've ever gone to  feeling like my time was utterly wasted and like I've made a chicken scratch in an issue solid as ice and twenty feet deep. I balance on a fragile thread of life and death and I'm scared that it is only a matter of time before something tips the balance just far enough that I finally do ""it"". My biggest fear is that by the time I find a way to heal myself  if I make it that far  my kids will have paid the ultimate price and be a product of confusion and sadness too. I am sick and tired of trying to feel human. In talking with others  I feel intangible  fake  this intellect in human form but incapable of human understanding. My emotions are real; love  hate  empathy  grief  anger  happiness  but I still do not feel ""real"". I feel like I am missing some vital component that ties it all together  and without it  I am nothing more than this body walking around  emulating those around me  operating on some kind of autopilot. It goes beyond frustration and confusion  and I feel this pent up rage building inside of me  and I want to scream at the top of my lungs until I turn blue  throw a chair through a window  send dishes crashing to the floor  something through which I can channel the anger and get it as far from me as possible. And then  sorrow. Black as an abyss  tormenting hopelessness  and it is then that I contemplate suicide. Fortunately (or not) I will then remember something  some reason for why I can't do it. The other day was my sisters birthday. I didn't want her to have to remember her birthday as the day her sister killed herself. Then I bawl  because there is no way out. I can't leave  and staying means continued torment for me and the people I love  and for some reason  love me. How long must I endure this cycle? Once again I am off medication. After the birth of my third child I went on the latest wonder drug  Lexapro  and after a year with no improvement I've abandoned that as well. I also made another mental health check in when the baby (now 1 1/2) was a few months old  for six days in duration  and once again came out feeling like a hundred bucks only to crash again. I've examined the perspective that  like the books title  ""Depression is a Choice""  and have even embraced the idea. I've also embraced the idea that it is certainly not a choice  and that medication is the solution  with equally unhelpful results. I grow weary of this fruitless search to ""fix myself"". For those of you who would suggest God  yes I am a believer. I turned to him three years ago  after years of Agnosticism  in utter desperation to fill in the ""missing link"". But for whatever reason  He still isn't enough. Which is the biggest blow of all  because I truly comprehend the sacrifice that was made in my behalf with the Atonement  and yet for some reason fail to utilize it. So here I am. One big mess. And I'm joining the group  lucky you! See you around",1
 For some reason ... I am never happy anymore ... It all started a little less than a year ago. Suicide attempts  cutting  burning  hair pulling  slapping  basically just wanting to die. People tell me my life isn't that bad just because my family has money. Money isn't everything. Also  everyone spreads rumors about me  and tells me crap to my face!!! My boyfriend is really sweet and I LOVE him  but he has a serious anger issue! His psychologist diagnosed him with an anger issue. And lately when he gets frustrated  he sometimes hits me. Not like REALLY hard  but hard enough to leave a mark. Then later he doesn't remember doing it. I'm worried about him  and myself. I don't want our relationship to end because of our problems. And none of my friends understand why I cut and stuff. It's not always for attention you know!!! So  if someone could please email me at xxx. Or reply. That would be great. Please talk to me ,1
 I'd just like to thank you all i am comforted to know I'm not the only one who feels like this  I'm 24 and until october last year i had it all a great job a fabulous fiancee ( awful future in laws) but you cant have everything and we had harry the dog but then it all changed i had an eptopic pregnancy that i think started it all my future in laws said it was only ibs and they were at the hospital with me and kept making me drink hot water then my mom went in to hospital with severe liver failure when i walked in the hospital she was bright yellow something i have never seen before think ten times worse than george best she has got severe brain damage and doesn't know who she is most of the time . we have been told she has not got long left so i spend most of my time there but its killing me i just don't know how I'm going to cope when she goes and to top it all my now ex fiancee dumped me because I'm not spending enough time with her and taken the dog i just feel like I've lost or about to lose everything i have ever loved  i went to my doctors yesterday and begged them to help me so they have given me cita things but they say that you can get a bit worse before i get better and i don't know how much more i can take  sorry for going on but that's me   ,1
 Well  I've never cut before ... I've been tempted  but I'm so afraid that someone will notice and ask questions ... I don't want to talk about it ... Instead I hit my head against hard objects (walls  desks  tables)  or I dig my nails into my skin  or sometimes I bite my lips or my arms hard until they leave marks  but nothing permanent  in case someone were to notice ... I don't bang my head as much any more  but sometimes I want to ... I want to hurt myself and I don't know why  it just pops into my head ... anyone else do and / or feel similar things??   ,1
 i can only do so many intro's  then i get real sick of talking (writing) about me. i have depression/anxiety. I'm not medicated  and though the va would provide medicines  I'm done with them for now. Now that I've not homeless anymore i have the stability to get proper rest and nutrition  which have been sorely lacking. I've just started taking vitamins  and though i did get a membership to the ymca to work out  I've yet to bottle up the anxiety enough to go in. i used to love being in the gym  now it's available  and I'm frozen to my apartment. it will come. I've had stability for three weeks now  and I'm essentially relearning life. I've had to make myself go out and walk around the park at three in the morning to get exercise. With God's help  the support i can gather about  and an open heart  i will regain my sense of self. Thank you for being here so that i can post this. i know that you folks understand. Peace,1
" anyone who can offer me advice on this it would be amazing! my girlfriend is the greatest girl I've ever met  i love her and want to marry her eventually. Here's my problem though: she's still in high school. and ever since i moved away to university i have been constantly constantly worrying about things i can't control. like when she drinks with her friends  and whether or not I'll still love her in a month  whether or not she's going to suddenly ask herself ""what am i doing in a long distance relationship anyway?"". these are all ridiculous things to worry about. not only because she loves me to the ends of the earth  but because i have ZERO control over them. these worries are driving me insane and slowly ripping up our relationship. does anyone have any advice to offer?

 i am 20 years old. i work a landscape job. my girlfriend who is pregnant lives 3 hours away. i love her to death and plan on marriage but i cannot stop thinking of her past sex life. Its small numbers and very insignificant compared to my past but for some reason i cant brush it off. i wish we were each others' first and so does she.  we fight constantly  mostly because I'm so irritable and defensive. She's happy in cosmetology school. i think I'm jealous of seeing her so happy with life and me hating it so much. i feel like i have no goal in life. I'm going to try to become a tattoo artist and move down there to be with her soon. we are amazing in person but when we are apart it is horrible. i went from living near her to far away and i hate it. i think about her all day at work and can't talk to her because i don't have a phone at work. i can't stop digging into her past.  when we do fight i hurt myself and it makes me feel better. i cant afford professional help or medicine because i have no insurance. i am getting better and i am happy that I'm moving with her. but what do i do until then? ,1
 Hi there  I have never posted anything before so I don't know if this will work. Does anyone have that feeling in the back of your throat like you are going to cry? I have it off/on throughout the day sometimes it is so bad I have to really concentrate not to let the tears come. I'm on Effexor xr now and adrrall 2x/day. Sometimes the medicine makes a difference but most of the time not. I have been on a bunch of other medicines but they usually only work for 6months then the feelings of sadness come back again. Anyone else had this throat feeling?,1

" Well I'm getting ready to go back to school so I'm trying to get sober for a while and see i can clear my head. So far I've been sober for about days and i must say I'm not feeling any better. Some of the problem is probably zyrtec which I'm taking for my allergies but really i just feel really irritable and confused. i can't really think too well and it's making me want to drink. Drinking slows down my mind somewhat so i can focus on things in my head. Normally its not till the next day after a good night of drinking that i feel good for most of the next day. i am more talkative and can come up with things much easier. There are people who use Prozac and other anti-depressant drugs not because they want it but because it makes them feel even better than they normally do. This is somewhat my issue with alcohol however i don't fell good normally i feel like s**t normally. i guess i should let u in on what is really bothering me. First ill just list the problems i have i find most worrying. Night blindness ""fuzzy vision"" bad sinus pressure moderate fatigue all the time short term memory problems random aches and pains major depression  anxiety  and ocd bad allergies acid reflux. To be honest most scary one is night blindness. Trying to explain is pretty difficult but ill try. It's like being able to see all the cons and rods and your eye flash on and off constantly kind of like a bad channel on a TV screen. I've had it for years now with no one who can really give me straight answer about it. i went to my doctor recently and got up the nerve to tell him but thought he gave me some good info he probably thought i was mad. Anyway one of the first things your body will do when it's over exerted is give u fuzzy vision. Now normally night blindness is caused be a vitamin A deficiency. Maybe there is something wrong with my stomach that is making me feel the way i am and i did have kidney stone when i was 2 which is very rare. i know this is a lot of information but this is what i deal with on a ""daily"" basis. My daily routine is almost exactly the same except on weekends when i do go out and drink with my friends. my will is low and energy just as low so i find myself kind of in and out of this trance that is supposed to be life. Each day i go to work  come home  eat  and up to my room for pretty much the rest of the night. don't get me wrong i do other things during the week sometimes but i feel most comfortable by myself in my room as opposed to human contact which sucks. So if i have to drink to keep from going over the deep end then i will do so until i get some real answers. If anyone has any answers I'm all ears.",1
" Hi everyone. I am here because I am very depressed due to uncontrollable situations of extreme stress this year and a lifetime of stupid choices that have led me to where I am today: lonely and sad. I talked to my primary dr. and now have been taking Zoloft for almost 2 months. It seems to help some  I don't feel like I will panic to the point of losing control completely. And I am seeking help  I don't have a therapist yet  but I checked with my insurance and wrote some names down  now I have to pick up the phone and speak into the receiver and set an appointment. My plan is to do this on Monday. I like to be supportive of others  so although I do sound gloomy  I hope to meet others who are making progress and maybe be of help to you  too. I will post more later I feel the need to sleep. I have trouble with sleep and nightmares and eating  lately I have to force myself to eat  I have a weird aversion to food  I start to feel sick & queasy when I try to eat. But life in general makes me sick and queasy. I am alone for the Holidays which suits me just fine. I wish I could go to the ""Island of misfit people"" and stay there and never leave. For now that is the comfort and safety of my home  unless I go to work or need groceries. Later...",1
 Hello everyone. My name is Amy. I discovered this page just by searching on the internet for depression forums. One good thing about me  I believe  is that I'm very mature for my age. I am seventeen  and really hope everyone here is open-minded to age being just a number. So please  do not reply telling me I will have it better later on  or my problems are because of my age. I know there is a possibility that things will get better  and believe me  I really do not think this has to do with teenage hormones. I have read about many middle aged women and men with the same problems. I understand that I am a very negative person  most likely due to depression. I am very irritable  only maybe once a week I am happy for most of the day. I also know that I have never really been happy. I have never been optimistic  and have always been sensitive  emotional  and not very confident. At the moment I do not have any friends. I haven't really had any friends for a few years now. Once every few months or so I'll go out  and then just want to leave within a couple of hours. It's very stressful to me. And when I do want to leave  I just tell myself I have a problem  because everyone else I know seems to get along with people just fine. I am also like this with jobs. I go in and out of jobs. One time I even faked a family emergency just to leave work...and I was crying about it. If one thing goes wrong for me  if I smile at someone and they don't smile back  if I feel insecure in any way  my first reaction is to flee. I also  for the most part of my life have always been in a relationship. My boyfriend as of right now and I have been together for over a year. Both of us cheated on each other in the beginning of our relationship  which might be the cause of our jealousy problems now(mostly mine). But  before this relationship  I also had the same problem. I never felt good enough  I believe I will never feel pretty enough. I have big issues with porn  and basically every little thing you can think of. Recently I've been reading about depression and anxiety. I feel the more I understand how and that it is a part of me  the worse I feel about myself. And the more insecure I feel. I feel like I am not fun to be around since I am irritable and sad most of the time. I feel like my boyfriend will find someone who has more of the good qualities. I feel that I will never satisfy or make my parents proud  since I keep leaving jobs. They tell me I'm just lazy. I have quit every single thing in my life that I've tried since I was young. But I really think it's because of my mental state. Going out in public is terrifying  because I don't want to feel bad  ugly  unfun  or not funny. I fear social situations  because I am horrible at making conversation. I've been considering therapy and depression/anxiety pills  but my mom tells me people who take them basically just don't feel anything at all. And I am also afraid to see a doctor and share my feelings. I feel like I have no one to talk to. My dad and I have never had a good relationship  we maybe say two words to each other a day. We have had kind of a bad past  and maybe that's the reason for our lack of communication. My boyfriend doesn't really know how to talk about important or emotional things  unless they have to do with him. I feel like every time I cry I push him farther away from me  and feel I have to hide everything because me being depressed is a turn off to him.  I don't know. I guess we all have to vent somewhere  and to know that there is a place where people feel the same is a great thing to me.  I wish there was an easy way to feel good about myself  and just be happy for once. But I suppose these things take time and a lot of effort. I'm sure I left some things out  but this is all I want to throw at you all for now. Thank you for listening. ,1
 Why I always let myself fooled... Why I always think there is something more than there really is... I always think I'm good friends with someone and I act accordingly. I try to be that good friend. Then at some point I always realize that it's not a real friendship. The other one didn't think it that seriously. The other one just talked with me because at that time it was fun. It feels crushing. Realizing every single time that the person you took as a good friend  or even possible friend isn't really thinking same about you. Realizing how stupid  silly and naive you have been thinking that you could be a friend for that person. Realizing how they just are amused that you were so deep involved in it.,1
" Here's a new update for interested readers. Bad news first: I got a voicemail last week  it said my mother was in the hospital. It took me awhile to get more info  I called and left a message where she lived because it was too late to get anyone on the phone there. I finally found out where she was and called the hospital. They said she was having problems walking  that maybe she hurt her back. That she was getting breathing treatments because she had trouble breathing. Part of it was she couldn't smoke  part of it was probably because she does smoke. They didn't seem to find out what caused the problem with her legs. Then she had some other stuff wrong. Part of the good news was one thing they thought was wrong was caused by a shot they gave her  and it was solved the next day. Now  I called her Friday and she said her heart test showed a tear in a valve. She is getting a more detailed test next week  the doctor said it is too early to tell how serious it is or if it needs anything done to it. He told her  it could be just something minor that needs to be monitored and could cause no problems at all or it could require heart surgery. So I was very worried about that. My first thought when I heard she was in the hospital was that she would end up having cancer from smoking  or liver disease from drinking. But I didn't think of any heart problems. I am hoping that it won't be anything serious  or that if she needs surgery that it will be successful and she will recover without any complications. I don't know much about heart surgery  I know I've heart that many bypass patients have good surgery but get sick and die from complications after the surgery. I hope and pray that she will be ok  I live far from her and can't do anything but call her and pray. Now some good news  my new job is going to switch me to fulltime hours next week. I still have to find out if it will be temporary or long-term  but I'm happy either way. I went from poor and going to be homeless  to having a place to live and a low-stress job in a short time. Each day I wake up and am alive and have a place to live means a lot to me now. It kind of gives me a better perspective on life in a way. I know so many people have it worse  so much suffering in the world and I'm lucky. I have to get some new clothes because changing to fulltime I have to go by a different dress code  so I'll be looking for cheap nice clothes tomorrow. I'm thankful I have some money to look for clothes. I'm still adjusting to things  sometimes I feel like ""where am I  what's going on?"" but it is better than before when I was at my apartment thinking ""when will I get kicked out  where will I live?"" I'm trying to take it one step at a time  not worry about where I'm supposed to be going in life. I'm thinking  what do I need  get things stable  be able to support yourself  get a phone  get car insurance  get more hours at work etc... I try to stay positive and be grateful  but still I'm a little lost. If anyone wants more details about things  or advice on how I've coped with anything just leave a reply and I'll answer you. I have a lot of things I've learned and advice  but I don't go around telling people what to do or pushing my point of view. I try to just express myself without pushing.",1
 To start off I have had depression quite consistently since I have started college at 18. I am now 22 and my depression was getting pretty bad again  then I met this girl about 4 months ago. We started dating and it turned out we and tons of similar interests and very similar morals. A few days after we started dating she told me that she was going to australia to study abroad for 10 months  weeks later she told me she was afraid to lose me I told her we would worry about it when the time comes. Since then we have had some really great times doing things we both love together. Yesterday we finally had the discussion of what was going to happen when she left. In my mind I was hopeful that we could maintain this relationship despite the obvious obstacles. I told her I cared about her more than anyone I have ever dated and said that I wish we had a chance together. She told me she doesn't believe in long distance relationships  this kind of broke my heart but at the same time I knew it was the logical choice in this situation. She told me that she did not want to cut me out of her life and that she wanted to stay in contact with me. She also said that if it was meant to be that it will happen for us. My family has been very hesitant about our relationship because they worry about me spiraling downward when she leaves. I am a little worried about myself as well  today I cried on the way to school and during my break between classes. She leaves in 6 days and she still wants to see me as much as possible before she leaves. I am so afraid to lose her and scared of how I will feel when she is gone. Please help.,1
 I am 34 year old single mother in a weird relationship and living in a place I can't seem to adjust to and is very far from my home and my family.  I am broke  have hardly any job prospects  and do not own a car.  I do not get along with the father of my daughter and just got swindled by his lawyer so he does not ever have to pay child support (long story).  He's an ass!  I have had 2 abortions and 1 miscarriage in the last three years and am very regretful for them and can't seem to forgive myself.  My parents and I are not speaking due to my mother's alcoholism and my choice to move so far away.  My partner has recently decided he does not want to have any children  which was the straw on the camels back  and on my birthday I had a complete breakdown.  I have had depression for as long as I can remember  along with anxiety.   Due to these events the last four years  I have just recently dived into the world of antidepressants.  I took Wellbutrin SR 300 mg for about 1 month and it does not seem to do much.  My doctor gave me Cymbalta 30 mg  and it also seems not to do too much.  Not sure if I can combine the two or not.  Does anyone know if you can?  They both decreased my appetite noticeably  but my energy level is still low and and I still feel a little anxious and depressed.    Anyway  that's a little about me and my situation. ,1
" My formative years were spent in small towns. Until the third grade  I lived in Indiana. From the third grade through my junior year in high school  I lived in a small lakeside community in southwestern Michigan. You could walk or ride your bike to anywhere - down to the lake  out on country roads  wherever. My father was a Lutheran school teacher  principal and church organist. From time to time  he would take a ""call"" to serve in another Lutheran school in a different town. In the summer of 1968  right after my junior year in high school  he decided to take a call to a school in the north side of the city of St. Louis. It was quite a culture shock for a sheltered young woman who had only lived in small  insular towns all her life  to move to a city the size of St. Louis. Quite honestly  when we arrived here I absolutely hated it. I felt as if I'd been thrown to the dark side of the moon. I had to start my senior year in a new high school in a completely foreign environment. Everyone else already had their group or circle of friends going back at least three years. Now you had to have a lot more guts and fortitude and self-esteem than I had at the time to break into already established groups and make new friends. This was the year that would set the stage for the first major depressive episode in my life. This was the year of my first therapist  the first of many to come. The start of a lifetime of self-discovery.",1
 Hi I'm Ricky  I'm 17 years old and I think I've been living with depression for the past 2 years. I've been through a lot of issues in my life that makes my life feel so unbearable and lonely. I haven't been through any therapy so I haven't been diagnosed with depression but I obviously haven't been feeling happy. I'm a senior in high school and I hate going to school every morning  I don't feel like I fit in really. Reasons are because I'm a social outcast and I don't really like being around other people because I may seem to be off tangent. People seem to judge me too quickly and this really pisses me off  or is it that I'm way too paranoid. I zone out a lot and just stare at people without even saying a word to any of them. Like I'm really anxious around them and I feel completely uncomfortable. I started smoking weed when I was a sophomore and ever since then people such as my friends seem to drift away but it didn't really bother me till now. I don't really have that many close friends other than just friends that I smoke with. My parents say I should avoid those friends just so I can get a better perspective in my life but then I don't know how to make new ones. I really want to make new ones because I want to have a better social life but I don't know how to get myself motivated. I want someone to care for like a girl friend  just so that I don't feel so lonely  but then again I don't think I can have a healthy relationship. My parents also say that I should be more open with God but I don't have any faith (if I don't even have any faith in myself  how could I have any with God). I just turn away and just hide and just think that it will all be different the next day but never is. Please I need some help because I don't want to feel even more depressed. Ricky,1
 42 year old male newbie  just discovering that I suffer from depression. While there has been evidence all throughout my life  and while I have family members that have suffered from depression (grandmother committed suicide)  I for some reason am just figuring out now that I suffer from the disease. My questions for those much more experienced and knowledgeable on the forum. 1. How would you go about your initial steps of diagnosis and treatment? I currently do not have med insurance  so cost is certainly an issue (we should have medical insurance in place in about a month  as part of my wife's new employer package). 2. I take a healthy dose of vitamins daily  including proteins such as L-Tyrosine  which helps me feel really good when I'm not under the effects of depression. Does anyone on the forum have experience with L-Tyrosine and its impact on their feelings of depression? I understand that the amino acids help with the production of dopamine and helps with brain function. Any comments? A little background: I am just coming off a very successful 4 year period where I started a complicated new business and got married again. However  during these last few months I have been unable to work at my previous pace  putting my business in real jeopardy. In fact  there are only a couple of days per week where I seem to be able to work  and typically only a few hours at a time during those days. When I do work I get exhausted quickly. Today  I had a major conference call that required some preparation. I was very up during the call  but then collapsed afterward in complete exhaustion. Seems to be the story for me recently  I can psych myself up for short bursts of performance  then I quickly decline again in an inability to concentrate on anything other than light web surfing. I continue to get up early and exercise daily. I live a healthy lifestyle  eat well  and walk 5+ miles every morning. I sleep regular hours  however  will sleep a few hours during the day during my 'down' days.  Looking back at my past  I am now clearly seeing times in my life where my performance level went down drastically  or where I had problems with relationships. At the time  I didn't realize anything was going on  or I simply didn't understand it. I can now go recall having real problems with my grades during my freshman year of high school. At the time  I recall saying to myself that I couldn't understand why I was performing so badly. It was as it something was holding me back and I could not overcome it. At the time  I just kept studying and working harder  but I was unsuccessful. Eventually  I got through it and my grades went back to normal. But all of these years I never really understood what happened in that freshman year  until now. In summary  there have been many other times in my life where things have fallen apart and I have not understood why. My past is littered by successful businesses that I have created and then have eventually failed  usually by my inability to maintain my performance level. There has obviously been a pattern that I do not yet understand  but at least now I am beginning to see why there was a downturn. Thankfully  I have now met the women of every man's dreams. While she knows I am depressed I have not yet let her know the depths of my despair or of my recent understanding of my past behavior. The good news here is that I have great family support  but I am wrestling with how much to tell my wife about what is going on inside my head. She gets stressed easily and will worry deeply about me. I'm not sure I want to lay that all out on her. Anyone else find themselves in this dilemma? Well  thank you for giving me the opportunity to share and to join this forum.,1
 We have been playing Quake 4 almost every night for a little while. We play online against other players using Xbox Live and it is very cool. Most people are friendly. We have made some 'friends' and we find them and play with them. One time I found some person talking too much trash and you can go in a mute them or set a preference to never see them again. Well  last night I encountered a group who had a feud going. One kid was talking too much trash and people on the other side were just going with it. I figured one game was a not a big deal. But sometimes you end up finding them again and again in the same night. I have this guy some slack and didn't say anything but then later I got to play as part of the same team with him. What a jerk. He kept asking me to give him the flag so he score it and get the points instead of me. Forget about the team winning  this guy wanted all the points for himself and didn't care about the team. I had to set him straight  and after the game I had to report him as being a trash player and set in my preferences to never see him again. After that I saw the other players and they were all nice. It only takes one guy to ruin a great experience. Overall  playing online with all these people and talking with them is great  you just have to know when to cut someone loose. Eventually when many people report him as being a jerk  he will be banned from the game. Oh well.,1
 I can absolutely relate to what you're going through. I understand how difficult it is adjusting to so many different personalities. Ten people in one apartment is overwhelming  to say the least. I used to live with four other girls who had diverse interests  and unfortunately we all kept to ourselves because of the different personalities. It was best that way. In your case  it seems like you're making as much effort as you can to be social. There's no need to go out on a limb to prove that you're not anti-social. When I had depression I really needed my space and the last thing I wanted to do was socialize with my roommates. Luckily  I am in my own apartment and have been living alone for three years now. It has helped enormously. I wonder if you can request a transfer to a bachelor suite where you can live by yourself. I did that in my 3rd year and the apartment manager put me on a waiting list  and I was able to get my own living space by November. Even though the moving was a hassle  I never regretted it. As for finding ways to spend time away from the noise of other people  I usually take the bus to visit a bookstore that is far away from campus. I go there every weekend to relax and read. It's away from campus life and it has helped me sort out my thoughts. The suggestions made by others such as the library  and a park are wonderful too. Maybe you can purchase a bus pass? I have depression and social anxiety  so it was difficult dealing with the university atmosphere on my own. I made only a couple of friends who have since moved on or graduated. I too saw a school counselor  but it was short-lived. What helped me  other than getting away from campus  was getting some online support from forums such as this one. I also kind of clung to one friend at a time  instead of many groups of people. I'd go to the movie theatre and watch something funny  or I'd take long walks. You're not alone. Hang in there and keep posting if you feel really down. I think this forum is very supportive and people will try to help you the best way they can.,1
 I have been on 50 mg of Zoloft for 6 months now  and I have the worst night sweats!!!  I haven't had any other side effects from it other than the night sweats  but this side effect is enough!  I get them about every other week and they last for 4 - 5 days.  Sometimes it is so bad that I wake up 3 times a night to change my clothes because I am drenched!  I just wanted to know if anyone else has had the same experience?  I'm thinking of getting some blood work done to rule out anything else even though my doctor says that it is definitely caused from the Zoloft since I never had this problem before! ,1
 i'm new here  i'm 26 years old and i have been taking effexor for 4 years now. i have struggled with insomnia  and taken just about everything out there (trazadone  seroquil  lorazepam  clonazapam ...) i have been on remeron for a month now  30 mg at night and i find it works well but i am worried about the side effects  particularly weight gain  i have noticed my appetite has increased  any tips? i hate to go off  since it actually works. i would appreciate any advice. also  my sex drive has become a big fat zero lately  and that is very odd for me. i am single right now  but i can't even imagine having sex with anyone including myself!! i've asked about wellbutrin  but was turned down by my doctor who didn't think it would be right for me. any thoughts?,1
 Hi  I have posted a few responses on the forum  but this will be my first thread. I guess I am wondering if I truly suffer from depression or another mental illness. I have not seen a psychologist or a therapist  but I have been reading your threads for the last few weeks. My heart goes out to you and I wish that I could lend more support than I can. I know that my situation is not nearly as dire as many of you  but I still ponder whether I have a iproblemi. For the last couple of years  I have experienced an increase in mood swings. I will be doing fine and then a ilight switchi goes off  and I get a bad case of the blues. These can last for a few of days. In my mind  I know that everything is actually okay  but I can't shake the idowni feeling. I also have frequent bouts of being istressed-outi. By this I mean that all of the tasks that I need to get done seem to be insurmountable and that there will never be enough time to get things done. I sometimes break down in tears during my more manic attacks of frustration and worry. Life seems to have become one long list of stuff to do. Even the fun stuff has become something to get done so that I can move on to the next day. As for itriggersi  as I have been reading about in your posts  I know that I have two major issues. I don't deal well with my emotions when my husband gets angry (not abusive  just normal iguy angryi) or I feel that I have somehow iscrewed-upi and let him down by not doing something right. I turn very inward and the ilight switchi goes off. My second issues deals with embarrassment. I do not take embarrassment well. My stress/anxiety over getting the housework done stems from my concern that people may come over and I will be embarrassed by the state of the house (in fact  the house is always neat and clean  if a bit disheveled by daily life). I often worry about whether I embarrassed myself during social outings or at parties with my friends. My husband reassures me  but that doesn't usually ease my worry. My ObGyn gave me Sarafem (Prozac 20mg) three weeks ago  and I seem to be operating on a more even keel these days. The lows aren't as low and I seem to be able to let more stuff just roll off my back. I am pleased with the results  and my husband has seen a real improvement  but I am still asking myself the basic question as to whether I am indeed ill. Please provide some feedback if you can  as this is the first time that I have tried to really tell folks about how I feel.,1
 I'm 22 years old  a proud mom of a beautiful little girl who's almost 2 and she is the only good thing in my life.  We live with my parents and that just makes me feel like such a failure  that I can't provide for my child.  I love her to death but she was an accident and I do wonder what it would be like if I didn't have that responsibility  I always tell myself that I'm sure lots of young single moms think that way as long as I'm there for her it's okay.  I've been seeing my neighbor for 8 months now  he's 9 years older then me and my daughter has grown attached to him and I am so in love with him. But I don't know what to do everything is so messed up with him and I  it just seems like he stopped caring and I feel like I'm not good enough for him  for anybody.  I don't have anyone I feel like I can talk to and this is all new to me so now I feel like I'm rambling on about stupid things when there are other people out there with worse problems then me  but I'm just so sad and don't know what to do....,1
 Ok  sometimes i feel so pathetic because i have these friends who are pretty and could have any guys they want but they don't really care about getting married  and here i am ugly and that's all i can think about. I don't know why but i feel like there is some kind of pressure on me to get married. Because my cousins  who are like my brothers  both left home before they graduated and started dating younger girls so i feel like I'm a failure b/c i still don't have a boyfriend and I'm almost 16.I'm not sure if they really think that or if i just imagine it but either way that makes me want to hurt myself but then I'm like what good would that do me and if my arms and legs are all messed up then guys will definitely (spelling) hate me. I don't get why i care so much but i do. I want to be happy with my life and to be happy with what i got but i don't know how i always think that if i just forget about not having a guy in my life that i will be happier and maybe even eventually get one but it doesn't work but i don't know what i should do. So if you have any ideas please tell me .,1
" My Daughter turned 30 today.  I called and sent her a card  but she is not speaking to me.  Reason being ... I've helped her and her husband financially for approximately 2  years with the child care payment for my lovely grand daughter (she is 3 years old). I explained to both of them (daughter and her husband)  that I'd have to quit paying half the payment (273.00 per month)  after I get my 2005 tax return  because I'm planning on buying a new car.  I need a smaller car  and the one I own is from 1995 SUV.  I gave my older car to my nephew in Arizona.  He was driving a 1985 Toyota with no air conditioning.  He is thrilled to recieved my 1995 Passport (Honda)  that has many miles  but no serious problems. I was babysitting my lovely granddaughter one Saturday night.  When they came home from a party.  My son in law stunk of weed and he was drunk.  He was hugging his daughter (my granddaughter)  while he was stoned and drunk.  I was so disappointed.  I come from the old school that pot is bad. Being that my daughter was promoted to full time  and they both received a total of 2 000.00 tax return  I figure this is a good time to let them know that I'll no longer be paying for half their child care. My daughter blames my decision on the night her husband was very stoned ... I tell her that I can't expect ""the best"" for my granddaughter  when her own father doesn't care  as much as I do.  Plus  I had forewarned her that I'll be buying a car soon.  So ... now I have a new car .. but no daughter  and not granddaughter.  None of them are speaking to me.  I miss my daughter so much  and my granddaughter even more. please advise. ",1
 Medicines can and do stop working. I am going though this right now. I suffer from chronic depression. Had it since I was 5 and I am now 42 so I have been suffering for 37 years. God  I never realized how long it was! I sat in therapy for 4 years after my ex attempted to hang himself. I saved his life by taking him down from the noose with the help of my brother. The first words out of his mouth when he was out of his coma and the swelling went down was that it was all my fault. I knew then it was ME who needed the help. So for 4 years I sat in therapy and they never diagnosed me with chronic depression. If they did  they never told me or put me on medicines. When I switched therapists  that was when she said that I needed medicines. They gave me Prozac. That made a HUGE difference after the first 3 weeks. I took that for 6 years. Then I had gastric bypass surgery and when you have that  your body doesn't absorb the same so it stopped working. I took effexor for a while  did nothing  and now on celexa which is doing nothing at all. I am sitting here reading this forum and crying. So basically  medicines CAN stop working. Time to go get an adjustment.,1
 I can't do it anymore  i am waiting for the right moment to do it i know that i will do it i just need to wait for the precise moment i think that it will be off in the distance but a part of me welcomes it at any given time the chance to rid myself of this turmoil this pain this disgusted feeling i have inside of myself... i actually have began to feel more emotional and it scares me because i don't want to be like that but i don't want to be a rock either i remember everything what have a i become a monster stares into my eyes reminding me that i am not who i think i am that life is not great for me that it doesn't matter what happens to me because i so will leave and a weight will be lifted from those around me and i am okay knowing that there will be things that i will never see things i will never know but i accept it...,1
 I can't do this anymore. I can't keep telling myself I'm happy. I can't keep ignoring the pain! The constant pain...it won't go away...always there  a sharp knife in my heart. Day in and day out it hurts  whether I'm happy or not  it hurts. I can't do this anymore. All I want is for the pain to end...just end! I have nothing. Not a friend in the entire world who cares. Do you know what it's like to have no friends? Not one at all who can be there for me. I've got nothing to stand on anymore  nothing to cling to. I've got no reason to live left in me. I don't even have religion anymore. Christian  Buddhist...I'm not either  I'm nothing...I have no faith in afterlife  I just want to die. I can't keep living like this...I can't keep living. I am nothing...I have lost all hope  I have nothing but despair...nothing but constant pain  constant fear  constant hurt. I can't go on like this  even physical pain is better than this. How does one who is so fully dead inside...still be too afraid to die...yet want death to come so badly. Who does not care whether he goes to Heaven or Hell or nowhere at all.,1
" I'm new here  and I ought for help.  For the past month I've had a crush on this girl  .. but not a normal crush .. a real CRUSH CRUSH  the type of crush you really feel you need her since the first time you see her. She is my friend as of right now  I want to ask her out  .. but I am afraid she rejects me  and she wouldn't be my friend anymore.  I've been with depression for the past 4 days already  I even had suicidal thoughts. Last night I was looking for a HotLine to call and tell my story  I felt like I needed to talk to somebody.   I have friends  but not those type of friends that you can rely on  tell your story  and cry on their shoulders. Basically  i'm by myself in this world.  I love my parents  but I never tried talking about it because I just can't. They wouldn't understand  they ask too many questions .. we even had a minor discussion about me telling my mom NOT to throw the water bottle (I told her 5 times not to throw it)  and guess what she did .. she threw the water bottle .. and she told ""rrAhh  you should've told me"" .. Bad communication indeed  she needs to pay more attention to what I say.  I haven't eaten for a day because the depression has gotten worse .. last night a good ""cyber - friend"" logged on  and I knew I could talk to that person .. she's not kid  she's a grown woman (40 years old)  she has kids  so I knew she would understand perfectly. She talked me into not thinking about suiciding because of that.  Last night was the day that I cried the most  in my entire life. I'm still depressed  a little bit relieved because I actually talked to someone and let all that out.  I just need advices  I've been thinking of that girl ALL the time .. I wrote her letters as a ""secret admirer""  the ending of the letter was always the same: ""To the world you might be one person  but to one person you might be the world.""  I was also thinking that I was going to ask her out .. but like I said above  I'm afraid she might reject me and I fall into a deeper depression.  Please help  what should I do?  I'm 16  and I live in Miami.  Thank you if you have read my story.  EDIT: I have lost my self - respect  and lowered my self - esteem  and feel like if I'm a nobody. ",1
 Hello everyone  I am new here. I am Sarah and in my early thirties. I live in Europe and found this forum today! I just want to share my thoughts and because I was afraid anyone would find out about my feelings I searched for a foreign forum. And found it! I have been struggling all my life but after a series of events (death of dear aunt and suicide attempt off parent) I found myself starting therapy almost 2 years ago. At first everything was fine and I was learning a lot about myself and how to make my life easier and how to love myself. i really was hopeful and thought my life would finally get happier and maybe I would even meet some one to share my life with.... After a year of therapy I started feeling worse about myself and developed an eating disorder and a few months ago I also started feeling more and more depressed. At first I denied everything and even threatened to quit therapy because I was convinced time would heal me....well I now know that healing is not that easy. over the past two weeks I have been to a psychiatrist who wants to start me on Prozac (because it shouldn't make me gain weight  she thinks this would be the best ad. for me) and earlier this week i went to see my usual psychotherapist who said I was severely depressed and she urged me to start taking the medication because of my state of mind. I might loose my job in the near future and with all this extra stress my thoughts have been very scary. I am starting to think more and more about death and for this reason my therapist started talking about hospitalization! Off course I don't want that so I agreed earlier today to start with the medication....I am so scared about the side effects and don't know what i will do if I gain weight. Also I don't think I want to life if I loose my job...I think that will push me over the edge.  I hope I can find the energy to read more messages on this board and maybe get a good feeling about life again. Bye for now  Sarah,1
" Hi all... this is going to be a long post  but I'd really like some feedback on it... I'm kind of young  17. I'm currently involved in a relationship (long distance) with a boy who's a year older than me  and I love him more than words can say. The thing is  though  I'm a very depressed person sometimes.  I don't know if I'm making this up or if I actually read this somewhere  but I'm what I've heard classified as a ""seasonally"" depressed person: I experience depression more during the winter months (December through February) than I do any other time of the year. I have a lot of family problems that compound to my depression as well. When I was 13  I moved halfway across the country and I never accepted living here. I'm a city-girl  but I moved to the country. I feel isolated and alone out here  and I don't have anyone to talk to. My mother told me to ""buck up"" and ""get over it"" when I went to her about my depression a couple of years ago. She's currently on medication for her own depression. My father has a crippled arm (which he gained when we moved here) and has some addiction problems  so I don't go to him.  I have a very hard time trusting people. My mother and father were both abused as children  and my mother verbally abuses me. Recently  starting in about December  I started wanting to hurt myself physically again. The urge faded  but the depression lingered. For a while I've been emulating my mother on my boyfriend--I keep taking out my own anger and my own depression on him. I'm afraid that if I keep up with this behavior  I'm going to lose my boyfriend to my own selfishness. A lot of the time I wish I could disappear. I don't like being seen by people and I like to be alone  but at the same time I feel isolated in my soul. I tried religion  but I can't bring myself to place my faith in something I can't see. I'm really afraid that my depression is going to cause me to lose the one thing I even care about at all anymore in the world. I don't know what to do. My parents won't help me  my teachers don't know how to deal with it  and I've been to depression forums like this before and they really helped. I guess all I'm looking for is someone to lean on while I get through the winter months. If anyone has any suggestions for a homebody (my parents don't allow me to leave the house after school is over)  please let me know. Also keep in mind that I can't call people very easily with eavesdropping people in my house. Thanks. Sarina",1
 This is just the tip of an iceberg. One of my best mates has just gone to prison and he has a girlfriend  last night in the pub a good friend of ours was chatting her up and trying to kiss her so i said to him what are you playing at fellow your best mates inside and your doing this! he didn't even care! so i stormed out of the pub wanting to kick his head in. should i have stuck my nose in or should i have turned a blind eye? i think i did the right thing. We are a good bunch of lads who have been threw thick and thin together . But just lately all of us have been out of order to each other so are we really mates? what are mates? we are all stabbing each other in the back and its getting me down I think its because we are always drunk half of the time what do u guys think? is it all part of getting older? we are all in our early 20s now.,1
 This message is especially for newcomers desperately seeking a way out of the depression rut. Please read my words carefully as a lot of thought and devotion went into this:  A year ago  I was stuck in the miserable rut of depression with little or no hope of finding a way out. I was attending mandatory group therapy after an attempted suicide and 72 miserable hours in the nut house. They put me on Remeron which helped a little ... taking some of the edge off the suicidal thoughts  but little else. Weeks of trying to learn cognitive behavior therapy went by and hopes of getting better were dwindling. Then one day  my best friend gave me a book which taught me how to properly apply the CBT. Many of you have tried CBT to no avail. I sincerely believe that you did not do it either properly  hard enough  and / or long enough. When retraining the mind  it's vitally important to diligently apply CBT daily for several weeks. (See my webpage for more info: Antidepressant That Works). Once this becomes a regular habit  I'm confident you will see improvement as I did. I'm positive you can do it too. It was the toughest job I've ever had to do  but it sure was worth it. Whenever a negative situation presents itself now  I just block it out and replace it with a positive thought automatically. It's hard in the beginning  but it's totally do - able. Plus  it gets easier after awhile. Then  once it becomes automatic  you don't even have to think about it.  Properly applied CBT helps tremendously  but it's not a complete cure as you will see in my story. You must also take care of your body because it's what furnishes your brain with the proper nutrients. The two go hand in hand. The brain regulates the endocrine system and the neurotransmitters while the body provides the brain with the proper chemicals to do its job.  Leisure activities help also. I know it's difficult for some of you to have fun  but it's important to get your mind off your problems even if just for a little while. I mention motivation in my story. Sometimes you just have to force yourself to do what's good for you even if you don't want to. Contrary to what many believe  motivation begins with action ... not visa - versa. The sooner you begin to properly apply the techniques I learned and the more effort you put in to them  the sooner you will get better. Hopelessness and doubt will be your enemy  so try to put them aside for a month as you get on the road to wellness.  I have been off antidepressants for almost a year now. I feel great ... plus my concentration and comprehension are back. March 5 marked my one year anniversary without alcohol too. I'm basically drug free and am as happy as I was 5 years ago before the depression nearly ruined my life. ,1
" I am new here. I'm from Australia  I'm 27 years old next month  married with a 2.5 year - old daughter and a baby son on the way. I work in Insolvency (liquidations etc). I have been on antidepressant medication on and off for about 4 years now (initially Aropax  now Aurorix)  in hindsight I have actually suffered from depression for my entire life. I'm a similar personality to my mother who also suffers from depression. My younger brother and sister seem to have drawn the long straw as such  they seem not to be affected.  Things went downhill for me about the time I started on medication. I was in the early stages of a major gambling problem  and untreated depression had led to a real strain on my marriage. We split up for 3 months (during which time I made 2 lame suicide attempts)  reunited and seemed to get back on track  having our first child. Throughout this time the gambling problem intensified  and spiraled out of control to the point where I am now a bankrupt. During this time I also became extremely withdrawn to the point where I hate leaving our house and am more or less unable to cope with spending time with anyone except my wife and daughter. I also had something of a breakdown about 9 months ago  quit my job  which led to great tension between me and my wife (spending 24 / 7 together)  eventually she could not cope and moved out. Shortly after we worked it out and I moved in with her.  Things seem pretty good now  we are a lot more relaxed about things and we just seem to get along better  looking forward very much to the birth of our second  in about 6 weeks time. My gambling problem is pretty much dealt with (thanks chiefly to having little money and no access to it now) but I am still depressed  withdrawn and generally tired of life. To be honest  I am only around because of my wife and daughter  I feel little reason to exist other than for them.  I am also a christian and this is very hard  because there is a real burden of ""I shouldn't feel this way  I should be happy"". This leads to more depression  and at the moment I am reluctant to go to church  I don't pray or read the bible. I'm generally resentful of anyone who I consider to have a better existence than me (which is just about everyone). So while things are quite stable at home  I personally am at my lowest point in some respects. I am quite intelligent and every employer I have ever had has commented on my abundance of potential but lack of drive. So true  I lack any kind of ambition (and harbor something of an extreme opposition to materialism and the pursuit of money and possessions) and even now am tossing up whether to continue working. I have a chief interest (i.e. motorsport)  but other interests have been decimated e.g. I used to be quite a good pianist but now have absolutely no desire to play. I also can't get the motivation up to get involved in playing sport  which in the past has been a big part of my life.  So that's me in a nutshell. My extreme difficulty in taking on face to face help / relationships has driven me to get involved in some online depression forums as I think this may be a good way for me to start some kind of recovery.

 I've been on many medications in the past.  I was on Cymbalta last year for about a year.  Then I had a relapse and depressed again.  I changed to Effexor.  The meds never really work for me  I think maybe I am medication - resistant.  Maybe it is working and I don't realize  and maybe I'd be much worse without the meds??  Has anyone tried both Cymbalta  and Effexor?  Which one helped more?  or are they about the same. Should I go back to Cymbalta??  Has anyone quit a medication  tried something else  then went back to that same medication?  or should I try a different medication all together?   In past  I've tried Zoloft  Lexapro (allergic)   I am on Wellbutrin now with Effexor  also tried Paxil  Luvox  and Celexa. ,1
" Well I'm 13 so please excuse my grammar and spelling. Well it started almost about... 1.3 yr ago. I started to get large mood swings and would end up being sad or feeling guilty nearly everyday. That's when i discovered cutting myself. It started off as what does it feel like then grew into and addiction. I used to be doing it nearly everyday. IT made/makes me feel like there's nothing wrong. Well this grew bigger and bigger and i didn't tell anyone about it. After about 8 months i started to lie to myself and say everything was fine  It worked. Only temporarily. Around 3 months ago the feelings came back and i still have them at this moment. I have researched a lot about clinical depression. I still cut and i hate it. I came right out to my parents and said ''Maybe i enjoy cutting myself"" when we were in a huge fight. My dad turned around and said ""we don't care if you cut yourself"". This definitely didn't help. So right now i have one person i can talk to about it and has a good friend of mine. I checked the symptoms of clinical depression on Answers.com and i have 12/13 of them. I need to go see a doctor i know but i just can't. There's something stopping me and i don't know what it is. I just want to solve it on my own but i can't. I need Help. I have also been thinking about committing suicide and doing drugs but my friends that know i cut are stopping me. I know i will be missed. I just can't live on anymore... I can't see myself living past 18. Can anyone relate to this? Can anyone help?",1
" Oh my god.  I am THE most irritating person to be with recently.  It's just cry cry  cry.  Silly little things start me off then it just goes into the big list of reasons as to why  deep down I hate myself.  Then it goes into  you are ungrateful so ungrateful and a wimp a big stupid wimp an ungrateful selfish attention seeking wimp (go into the happy place go into the happy place  the nice view - wouldn't it be easy to jump from this nice view - find another happy place - stuff the happy place grab your teddy and go to sleep) you don't deserve to be alive you don't deserve this great boyfriend when all you do is pick petty little arguments and cry all the time at silly things (go to sleep you're tiring yourself out).  Then when i'm tired out i'll stop crying  then a few minutes later i'll sob then i'll get tired from that too and i'll brainwash myself with rubbish television.  rrgrrrrrrr i cant stand this.  this is slushy moany person i hate.  i'm turning into someone i hate.  i have been for ages.  i'm losing control.  i'm losing control.  ""it's not the end of the world they say"" well mine's crumbling away and it's all my fault and every time i get back into putting things right something knocks me down and every time things seem ok BANG! there it goes again streams of tears spurted from absolutely nothing.  what a blooming fool!  excuse all this craziness this has been my 1st really bad spell since i joined this site about a month ago just as my last one was becoming ok.

" Alright  I've been here before  to this site and this depressed on life.  I have experience that would get any person out of depression and live a pretty well rounded life.  Only to be honest I sometimes choose i think to be down and out all the time.  I was in recovery from a drug problem for 2 years and i developed a relationship with a Higher Power that really really helped with my depression / anxieties / addictions.  So it would be insane for someone who knows the solution to not use it right?  Well i've heard it said before  that once someone who had great faith loses it it makes it  more difficult for that person to find hope or faith  so that's where i've been the past 2 1/2 months  hopeless.      I tried Heroin after 2 years clean.  Looking for something to shut my mind up and find some comfortable peace due to my increasing loneliness and depression.  I only got real sick for about the two weeks i was on it and lost a job and apartment.  Then i moved back with my mom who has deep anger at my dad and life i guess who is with a man that is using her in my opinion  he's in a halfway house and just lays on her couch all day.   And my dad has deep depression / bipolar on every medication you could think of and lives with his mom who only talks about ""the divorce"" and how ""i should have did this different"" So really if i look at it long enough and deep enough they're alive but dead in a healthy emotional  spiritual  mental level  so where's the encouragement or love i so long needed as a younger person  and even most importantly i need some guidance now  instead of being ashamed of who they are.  I just need to vent.  I'm 22 i just started college last week and i am extremely anxious when there  I feel as though i wear a suit  outfit  costume of misery  fear  depression  THE VOID.  So it drives others away  plus i am ashamed of being a depressive / anxious dude so keeping others away is my aim.  I mean i'm 22 i should be getting laid and having fun right?!  Man i feel so old but so immature emotionally.  I talked to a friend of mine that is at Yale in Connecticut last night who has always been a good natured  smart  artistic guy  and a person who experiences depression but doesn't let it get the best of him  and he said to not dwell in the negative like i've always done  find something through out the day that is positive  a girl smiles at you  a song whatever.  MAN  I can't just turn my mind off from negative thoughts of me and others.    ",1
 Besides the issue with the jealousy which is probably related to this thread there are other things which you all may or may not relate to. i'm 24 years old but am feeling a huge burden to accomplish things from my boyfriend  parents and society in general. Not to say that i don't want to accomplish things ... i most definitely do thing is that i am not sure what area i should be focusing on. i'm in school currently for dancing and though i feel competitive i'm losing focus once again. i get bored easily and always want to try new things. which makes it impossible to advance at any one thing. i also enjoy writing and singing. i love singing actually but am not sure what or how to do anything with it. while some expect me to use my college degree to get a regular job ... which i'm starting to think is what i should do  others think i should waitress and do what it takes to advance creatively. all in all i am stuck. i am on my spring break and am doing nothing  i need a job and though i feel i need to go out and do something  i'm really depressed. how can i get out of this rut i'm in. and actually start doing things when i'm not even sure what it is i want to do?,1
" I'm a hetero man  35  divorced  no kids. I can honestly say that I feel empathy towards any guy who suffers from depression. Some of my closest guy friends have admitted to me their many bouts of battling these demons  just as I've shared my horror stories and near suicidal incidents  and we all have empathy with each other over that stuff. I'm beginning to not give a crap anymore about depression being viewed as just a ""woman"" issue; it is what it is and to heck with gender stereotypes. The things I've noticed the most are my friends' unwillingness to consult a therapist or take medication  but perhaps their bouts of depression are not the ""bed-ridden"" variety that I have gone through. Or maybe this is their way of not feeling ""completely weak"". Most of my friends will either drink excessively or take drugs to deal with this stuff. I tried to drink it all away  but in the end it just made me feel worse. I tried tranquilizers  but that didn't work. I tried booze and pills together  but still the depression lingered. Now I just smoke cigarettes and go running (what a dichotomy  I know) but whatever works  right? The only woman I've ever known who isn't empathetic or sympathetic to my depression is my mother.",1
" From the life I know. All I can say is  I know that after all we have been through. AND without preaching I know that you know that whatever your children choose in the path to lead you will support. BUT and HOWEVER I have many friends from all walks of life. And we all share the same childhood in more ways than not. And in any case  not one of our childhoods has sculpted who we are today  some of us on one side of the line some on the other... My father while eating dinner with my brother and I for the first time in years last night while meeting new friends and people made a very correct statement.. While my little brother is the ""marine"" and I being whatever I might be am the emotional one  (THIS IS TRUE) and yet my father has NO clue about my emotional status  issues what not... Just because one is emotional does not mean that his path is chosen. I'm going to stop being politically correct and y'all know what I mean :) :) or at least I hope so. I guess as I have lost my train of thought (crazy in the brain?) All I can say is just make sure that the kids grow up and learn to take care of themselves  never to rely on someone else to always make sure that they are taken care of.... In essence learn to wipe your own ass or you're going to be sorry because one day that ass wiper is going to be gone.. Keep being the parent you are and you will ""all"" make it out ok! That I can promise... I'm only 24 years old and I have friends across the planet from all walks of life... This I can tell you true...",1
 Hi all  I'm new to this forum and am in desperate need for help and advice as I've nowhere else to turn. I'll start at the beginning. I feel that I'm under a lot of stress with my job and the pressures of life. I feel that stress and depression go hand in hand. I'm not sure if I am stressed and depressed or if I have something medically wrong with me. That's where I need advice on what are common symptoms of depression and stress. At first I thought I was anemic as I am pale and don't eat a lot of meat so thought that my dizziness was down to lack of iron in the system. I also get eye strain but put that down to working on computers as a living. I have had blood tests for anemia  diabetes  blood sugar levels and other general tests which all came back fine. I have changed my diet and exercise more. At the moment I suffer from dizziness  eye strain  headaches  lack of concentration  irritability  lethargic and lack of co-ordination. If I'm honest I'm s***ting (Not sure if I can say that) myself as I don't understand what is wrong with me. I have a loving girlfriend and no money problems and a good social life but a stressful (if that's a word) job. Do the symptoms sound like depression and stress related or am I in the wrong ballpark here. Any help is really appreciated,1
 Hello  i am a 24 year old male. this is my 3rd time joining this forum... i joined once  had to resign in because it moved form .com to .org (or something) then i took medicines  was feeling better and kind of stopped coming here... now i feel bad again. :( i think this forum is a great resource... the people who started it should be quite proud of themselves... if i started something that touched this many people  at the mindsets that were at... maybe i wouldn't be depressed anymore. my 1 complaint  as i have mentioned b4... i think it is wrong to make people post 5 times b4 they are allowed  to create a thread... when people are here  feeling depressed  sometimes  (i would assume) suicidal... they should be allowed to post new threads right away. However  i don't mean to complain  as i do feel this is a great resource  and it's more then I've done to help the less fortunate in the world... good luck everyone.,1
" I'm in a reflective mood today. I received a phone call this afternoon from the sister of my old neighbor  who I will call Alice. She had passed away this morning. Alice had been fighting terminal colon cancer since March and after harsh chemo therapy and a bout with pneumonia that landed her in the ICU  she decided that enough was enough. She stopped treatment just around the July 4th weekend. I'm not too exact on the details  but suffice it to say that she failed quickly after that and passed away in her sleep this morning surrounded by family and friends. She was only 52. As I struggle with Depression  AD/HD  tic disorders  sleep apnea  insomnia  food allergies  pollen allergies  and a weak immunity system I sometimes feel that life is unfair. I used to say that the Universe was out to get me  that God's having his little joke with me. I suppose it's only natural to feel that way. It's a full plate and I'm not too hungry for what's on the menu. Then I encounter other people with other hardships and I see that life itself is not fair to an awful lot of people. Life is  in fact  a lousy chef. What struck me as sad today  however  was not simply the passing of somebody I knew. Instead I was struck with my own mortality and weakness. Let me explain. Alice and some other neighbors hadn't been too kind to me when I moved into the area. They had accused me of various deviant behaviors that to this day still anger me. These were supposed to be my Christian brothers and sisters and instead they wielded stones. The rumors mounted as the months progressed  wilder and wilder  until they reached a crescendo where they became so outlandish that it was easy to disprove them. When all the furor amounted to nothing a lot of people were left with egg on their face. That summer several of the families involved moved away. I have unresolved issues with them  but with Alice  my neighbor  I was able to find forgiveness in my heart. The story didn't end happily there with us arm in arm  though. Alice never really apologized to me  though her behavior towards my family and myself became kinder. Unfortunately  she was one of the people I knew who didn't believe in AD/HD. One day she told me her opinion on the subject right to my face after I mentioned I had it. I was so stunned by her bold opinion that I stood there slack jawed. I swore that day I would never let that happen to me again. You see a bit of that fire in this blog whenever anybody accuses me of not having a ""real"" problem. I am as fierce in person as well. Thanks to Alice. And now she's passed on. Suddenly my anger feels petty and shallow. She moved away and now has died  but I allowed her to change me. I nursed a wound like an angry coal in my heart. I forgave her for one thing  but held a grudge for another. She became representative of all the doubters in my life and I used that as impetus for change. What type of person does that make me? On top of that  I have set lofty goals for myself that are proving hard to meet. Time is ticking and my 40th birthday is but a scant five months away. One of the byproducts of meeting those goals was to have a book with my name on it that I could bring into her elementary school classroom one day  slam on her desk  and say ""Ha!"" - as if my success would mean anything to her. As if that would prove my struggle with AD/HD was real. How silly. How foolish. Alice was only thirteen years older than I. I can blink and be 52 tomorrow. Mortality laughs at me and replaces all of life's menu items with sour grapes and rotten eggs. What shall I order now? Usually  my sense of humor keeps my spirits alight. Today  however  I see myself as being revealed as a small-minded man with insignificant goals. That even for a moment  no matter how miniscule  I was sad she died before my goals were met... This both sickens me and splashes me in the face with a brisk dose of reality. December looms and I read news? Time leaks through my fingers and I'm worried about a drop in comments on my blog? How did I get so turned around? Where did I get so terribly sidetracked? I need to remember what it is I want out of life. It is not to show up the doubters but to find joy in my own accomplishments. I know that  but negative thought attaches itself to our most noble intentions like a parasite. Allow it to stay too long and it consumes and replaces what was once good and uplifting. I don't resent Alice. I never wished her ill. But I regret I let myself hold a grudge  however slight it seemed. Life is too short for such things. So I will allow Alice to change me again. That way when I order from the menu of life it will not be just desserts.",1
 everyone. well don't really know what to say so I'll just skip to the point. i haven't cut for a while but right now the thought of doing it again is looking really good. the last few days have just been really hard. i went from having a psychiatric assessment done to finding out that my mom had gone through my room and read all my personal poems and stories to then really wanting to talk about all this stuff to my boyfriend but not even being able to even do that. i just got back from seeing a movie with him and i just hate the fact so much that the one thing that i really want to do i can't because I'm a stupid freak that can't do anything right. i don't know but right now this is the last place i want to be. I'm just really tired. There are people that want me to talk and tell them what's wrong but i can't because I'm scared that they will run. that they won't understand and they just wouldn't care. I've already got a friend who is really annoyed at me because i don't try harder. i just really hate myself  i don't know what to do anymore. i just want to scream. i don't know what i need or want anymore. i just really need to cut but don't want to go back to it. i just don't know what to do,1
" Depression never ends does it?  You take the Paxil or whatever pill they prescribe.  You take it for years and years and every day you still feel so down and lonely and empty inside.   I'm sick of being sick.  I'm tired of being tired.  I don't know for sure if I want to kill myself or not.  I've made several attempts at it but then sometimes I think I don't really want to die I just want this life to get better.  Some people have ""normal"" lives don't they?  Why do they have normal lives  and what the heck is wrong with me?  Why can't I just snap out of it someday and be someone productive!?!?!   I HATE MYSELF  I hate the way I've made my life.  I want a job that says I matter  I want to rewind and start over knowing what I know now!  RANT RANT RANT - I hate life!",1
" I'm a traitor. I went to check out the other room without anyone knowing that it was me  just to see who was in there. While I saw someone stabbing me in the back  someone else pm'd me. Having a go  blah blah  how I shouldn't discriminate against people and make them leave THIS room.  I was thinking ""wtf?"" I never made people leave this room. All my problem people are on ignore and are left there *as it is in the rules*  So anyway  I just turns out that someone let this person know that I was a host from this forum masquerading  as if to get information from these people that have ""abandoned"" this chat. I Don't care about the other chat  other people shouldn't. You guys are welcome to wherever you want to go. You are banned for putting the link in the room and whispering it to people  which is AGAINST the rules. I know that the person that pm'd me feels bad  It ISN'T my fault. I didn't yell at her for making the mistake  I was understanding. I've made that mistake  I feel bad for it when I do. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO MESS UP.  So why people must bring stuff from THAT room into THIS room and make me so frigging angry again that I have to leave is beyond me. Why  if there are two separate rooms  can't stuff from the rooms STAY IN THAT ROOM?!?! It's so much easier. People won't get confused that way.  At this point I would just like to reiterate that I have no problems whatsoever with any of the people that go to either room. Anyone I can't handle talking to  I don't talk to. I just take objection to being asked about it here  where I come to forget about my problems  not be reminded of them.  And now  I've totally lost the thread of where I was going with this post  thanks to a whole bunch of reasons  and I'm getting too stressed to type  and all that's just irritated me further.  When I remember the point  I will add it or post it underneath.  Be strong and stay safe. ",1
 Ok  so i've had depression for at least 4 years and it has gotten a lot worse the past two. My mom tried shoving prozac down my throat and swore that it helped me  but it didn't. I didn't talk to a counselor until about a month a go.  I was going to school and every time i went to main campus i would get Ds and Fs. I would start out ok but then end up sleeping more and more. This past quarter i physically could not get out of bed at one point. My parents just saw it as me blowing my last chance at college and took it as i didn't care. It seems like i don't feel anymore. I do care that i blew my last chance at college and i finally decided to see a counselor 3 weeks before the end of the quarter. My parents said the only reason i did that is because i knew i was in trouble and just needed an excuse. I don't know why i don't do the things i know i should be doing. I just feel like i can't. My parents say it's all my fault  that i don't take responsibility for anything and I just want to blame everything on something else. Which isn't the case. They don't think that depression has anything to do with not trying  that it doesn't affect rational decision making. I'm starting to think it doesn't either. I mean  why can't i do the things i know I'm suppose to do? The things that will better my life. The things that will make my parents proud? Is it the depression or am I truly lazy and just don't care??? Because everything my parents are saying is making me think it really is just me and i don't have depression.,1
" I've been reading the ""hoarding"" thread in the OCD forum and I'm jealous. They're having fun bonding by sharing stories about their habits  so I thought we could do some of that with plain old depressives. Sometimes when I'm depressed  I realize that I'm crying over something so stupid that I have to step back and laugh at how upset I've gotten over dumb things. I can't remember all of them  but here are some of the ""highlights"" on the list of Silly Things That Made Starry kitten Cry: -my boyfriend told me his cat was giving me a ""mean look"". I set out a pack of Marshmallow Peeps to get nice and crispy in the open air and my roommate threw them out. (oh  there were tears!). The coffeehouse was out of soymilk on a day I really wanted some soy hot chocolate What's on your list?",1
 I really don't know what to do. I've suffered with depression for the past 6 years. It comes and goes with treatment. I thought i was over stuff but over the last little while it has got really bad again. I feel so low  so low and i can't pick myself up. I'm drifting away from everyone  they all enjoy going to the pub etc and i hate being with loads of people and i don't drink so i don't go out. They have given up on me now. I hate my job. That brings me down so much. I work for the ambulance service taking 99 calls and i can't deal with the pain and suffering of everyone anymore. A 15 year old girl died the other day whilst i was on the phone and it's just not fair. I just can't deal with stuff anymore. I feel alone  i am dull and boring  in debt and i just cant see the point anymore. The only thing keeping me afloat  and i really feel like I'm hanging on by the skin of my teeth is my boyfriend he is the only thing i live for and he is bound to dump me. It's like a vicious circle. I'm incredibly insecure and he will get fed of it and dump me. If he dumps me that will be it there will be nothing. I think about it all the time. I want time off so i can just be on my own but I'm screwing up my chance of finding another job so i can get away from this one. I don't know what to do. I am seriously thinking about ending it all and i don't know how to pick myself up.,1
  Im New to this site  I was diagnosed with SLE Lupus about eight months ago and i'm on very strong treatment using predinsone. Everyone around me noticed it first I guess since I was suddenly so quiet  moody and would cry at the drop of a hat. Which  was so unlikely of me I used to crack jokes laugh and my goal was always to have fun and make other's laugh. But since my diagnosis and medications (which I counted and i'm taking like almost 100 pills a week and I just turned 22 yesterday  honestly i'd never thought i'd be in this state at 22 a few years ago)  Anyway I never wanted to admit it  depression is not only a symptom of lupus but it's a side effect of the medication as well  and I think that it's a general first reaction to being told that you have an incurable disease. But I finally am starting to see it now I think that i'm really depressed.  I was never a quiet girl but now i'm so quiet that I think i'm scaring everyone.  but now i'm living with my wonderful boyfriend who seems to understand everything so well and is so patient with me. But I just need a place where I can talk this out with people who understand. ,1
 I feel sad. It is 1.46 am and I haven't gone to bed yet. Instead I am sitting here at the computer half heartedly trying to be part of the chat room  tears falling down my face. I feel so sad I can't even be bothered to reach for my phone to remove the razor from the back  or go down stairs for a bottle of wine. It makes me feel worse that this is been going on for so long that even the pathetic depressive coping skills have no effect on me. Pure pessimism  not even the chance of some temporary relief through an OD or spilt blood. Why did they seem to offer relief 3  5  6 years ago? I tried to eat normally today  I really tried. I failed though. I am trying to see myself properly  or at least come to the realization that I am not vile and unattractive  and obese. It still ends up with food all over the toilet. I disgust myself so much. I disgust myself because I let myself eat. I disgust myself because I think as I do  and I know that eating should be considered normal  but I can't see it like that. I disgust myself because I covered the toilet bowl in bits of chewed up food and stomach acid. I don't know what to say any more. I wish some one would say that I am going to feel better  but I've had that for the last 7 years  and I'd probably just be cynical any way. This post was pathetic  I'm sorry. Ruth,1
 I definitely think your right that my anxiety has sought out a fear that I dread more than any other and it is true that when I am not feeling depressed ( which incidentally is most of the time. This is only my second spell of depression in 39 years of life) I can mull over these thoughts and not be troubled with them in the slightest. It's really horrible how anxiety can feed off itself and lead you down this path to terrible thoughts. By the way when my partner was pregnant with our first child she to had dreams like yours and she was upset by them and she like you has turned out to be an attentive and first class mother.,1
 Haven't posted for a while because I've not been feeling too good. I'm becoming desperate and don't know what to do anymore. started taking ssri cipralex 2months ago and it has helped a lot with the anxiety and i thought it was helping my depression at first  but I'm starting to feel more depressed again. I've gained 2 and a half stone which is depressing in itself  but i wouldn't mind if i didn't feel depressed  i would rather be fat and happy  but I'm just fat. I'm feeling much more suicidal and worrying constantly what is wrong with me. i feel physically unwell too. Don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm taking vitamins and eating protein and carbohydrates and doing everything I'm meant to be doing  apart from exercise  don't have the motivation. just so frightened and don't think things will ever get better  just want to end all the pain. am seeing psychiatrist tomorrow and considering stopping the ssri  but have had terrible withdrawal stopping prozac in the past and am afraid. its like I'm damned if i do and if i don't. if he suggests switching  then what about more side effects  just can't cope with this terrible disease anymore  just want to fall asleep and die.,1
 I've suffered from depression episodes for about 10 years. Lately  due to major stresses at work  I'm back into feeling awful. I'm a good employee and have hidden my depression episodes well in the past but now I'm terrified that my new boss  whom I hate  will find out and fire me. I'm working double time to not be seen as weak and incompetent. I can't afford to get fired but am terrified that that my boss will use anything to get me fired. The stress of trying to be professional at all times at my job is just about killing me. It makes me so angry. When other employees have physical illness  such as cancer or heart problems my employer rallies around them and makes all sorts of accommodations but I've kept my depression a secret because I'm afraid it will be seen as a character flaw and I'll be fired. Plus I'm so paranoid  I'm sure when I come into work each day  I'll be escorted off the premises and I don't know what I'll do. Any advice from those of you who have been terrified of being discovered.,1
 Strawburygrlland has been invaded  discovered by someone too close-to-home  so I will be bidding y'all adieu. Damn  I thought I knew how to spell that... It has been fun. The site will remain  but will cease to be updated. If anyone cares to keep in touch  you can drop me a line the usual way. I may even start up a new  truly super-secret blog eventually. As for life right now  things are looking very positive. K & I are talking and in love again (still?). In fact  this past weekend Husband and I went up to their place and the 4 of us got busy and had a grand time in the bedroom. It was as amazing as the first time  possibly even better. We're looking forward to more adventures shared between the 4 of us  you can be sure. To everyone who has supported The Strawbury One  I owe you much. Thanks for not judging  and sending me so many cheers and well-wishes. You've been fabulous.,1
 this is my first post here.  Just wondering if anyone else has this problem.  I can't seem to motivate myself to do something with my life.  I'm married  no kids  quit school a couple years ago  just working the same job for five years  going nowhere.  I'm afraid of any kind of change  and I sometimes feel like life is pointless.  I get in these ruts where I'm stuck in this deep  dark pit of anguish and depression and everything feels completely hopeless.  It comes and goes  but these past few weeks have been particularly bad.  I was diagnosed several years ago with ocd  which has a lot to do with it  since I work myself into a frenzy of worry  imaging the worst possible scenarios for every situation  and I just shut down and don't want to think about anything  and it's hard to pull myself together and function like a normal human being.   Prozac helps  but I don't take it like I should. Just venting a little,1
" I've been dealing with severe depression for sometime now  and within recent weeks it has hit its worst (most of my posts were in the MNSEN area): lack of sleep  stress  behind on my work  can't leave my apartment  constant crying  hopeless need  etc. And during these few weeks I have taken the steps into getting into regular therapy again by consulting psych services at my school in conjunction with the counseling I get (or hardly ever get) from my hospital. The severity of my depression has been taking a toll on my friends and last night it seemed to reach its pinnacle. I'm not sure what came over me  I wasn't even drunk  but I started lashing out at a friend of a friend that was at the same party as I was. I started to verbally bully and attack him because he ""annoyed"" me  I don't know why I have so much pent up anger. It rapidly went out of control and before I know it my friends were holding me back and I violently threatened them. For the first time in my life  my best friend (closest friend) had to physically hold me against a wall  almost hitting me  to get me to come down. I just broke down after that  it wasn't even about that stupid guy anymore. I was suddenly overcome with loneliness and fear an jealousy and embarrassment. I've always been known for a very short temper  and my friends all know me to be very emotional  but I have never gotten so violent; I've hit and thrown objects before in anger and frustration but I've never struck someone. Though they all tried to console me that night  I feel even farther away from the few friends that I do have. Everything was hazy from last night  even though I had hardly any to drink... it wasn't so much of an intoxication  but more like a violent breakdown of sorts. I was so angry and I was desperate to physically hurt someone; it was quite a scene since I'm a petite girl starting a fight with a passive aggressive 6 ft male--some laughed it off at first as a Napoleon Complex  but it became serious when they saw how out of it I was. I just remember being so hurt and angry at my friends; I felt so alienated which fueled my anger at the world  at my life more... (As cliche as that sounds). And today I just don't feel like going out and I can't help but feel so alone. The way my friend violently had to restrain me scared me a lot---I've never seen her like that  and she is certainly not the type to behave like that... I pushed her to that point. It brought me back to an ex-bf of mine that I was very close too and who saw the worst of my depression as well; he too at one point had to restrain me violently (against his character as well). After an off and on relationship of trying to stay together  he couldn't take me  or my emotional instability  anymore. Last night  I had friends breaking down screaming at me that they were never enough for me (to make me happy or content otherwise) and it just brought me back to that moment with my ex. I feel as if that this cycle is in all my relationships--romantic ones and friendships. I seem to constantly push people away. I don't know what to do. I don't miss my ex-bf at all  but I'm scared that I will never be able to have close relationships/friendships. Everyone I know just pities me. I feel so completely alone and pathetic.",1
 I got up and realized I had not given my diabetic shot that I need to give at night. Therefore  my readings were off the chart  and I don't feel well. I hate this! I am trying to get my diabetes on track but i can't. I hate feeling as if I am so stupid that I can't control what my body does. I didn't get much sleep  I didn't have breakfast  I have a headache  I am getting sick  I didn't do well in a competition on Sunday that everyone that I would do well in  my grades in school are going down and grades are due Wednesday (let me know when I'm rambling!) and I have to be in school because its MONDAY. Top it off with trying to stop cutting and I have a very crappy morning to start out my week with. Anyone else every have a morning like this. I don't know what to do because I have to around people and I don't like people when I have mornings like this. Tell me  do these mornings get any better as the day goes on? Does anyone else have mornings like this  where all you want to do is stay in your room under the covers and read. Hmmmm. Well  school bell is going to ring. I'm glad I got this off my chest  but it didn't help as much as I had hoped. Anybody have any suggestions for making a bad day better?,1
 Hi  this is my first time posting a reply to something (besides the welcome new member forum). I feel uncomfortable replying to someone else when I don't feel like I have anything helpful to say  but I really need to get some stuff out  so I'll start here. I am staying at my parents' house right now for winter break (I am in college). I really wanted to come home but now that I'm here I think it was stupid of me to want to come home. Being at home with no one but my parents to talk to only fuels my depression. My dad is the worst. I feel like he's always judging me  and I'm a disappointment to him. I feel lazy and immature. I only have a few friends left here in my hometown  and I barely talk to them. The friend who I am closest to got a new boyfriend about a week ago  so she won't want to just hang out with me so much. And I understand that. The friends I am not so close to anymre  it is awkward talking to them. it always just goes back to high-school. So I am stuck home all day and I don't feel like doing anything but watching TV and sleeping. I feel awful. There is so much more that I could say but I'll leave it for another post.,1
 I'm going to start with the apology. To all my friends here  and everyone is  whether you've read anything I've written or not  I am so sorry that I have not been able to offer you support. I get into your threads  and the words just don't come. Sometimes the best I can do is just a hi  I was here. I'll start the explanation  but this thread may take me a week or so to finish  as I hate long posts  and it's so much effort to try and find the words. I am in major trouble at work. I'm to blame  although someone I thought was a friend  complained about me - I don't do enough work  don't work fast enough  and do not work efficiently or accurately enough  and she complained to the right person. Let's get out of chronological order. Due to weird circumstances  I went for about 3 months without medicines  and therapy. In November  I was at the bottom of a deep  dark pit  so called my psychiatrist  Barry. Surprising for me  I went back with a new  improved attitude. We'd had a couple of productive sessions when annual reviews came out. I called him for advice  and thought that while the advice he offered was good  that he was not being supportive at all. I actually thought about how to discuss with him how his response made me feel  rather than just shut him out. We had a couple of excellent sessions  which apparently told him that something had triggered defensive coping skills  and where my mind actually was. Can't write anymore tonight  other than  Scarlet  hang in there  you're in for the ride of your life. You truly are going to be a fabulous mother  trust me. Jill  that snail-mail card almost gave me a heart attack. You are beyond awesome  that you could reach out to me in the midst of your own problems. I will write  appropriately. Tiny  thank you. Cat  is Boerne anywhere near you? Enough  thanks for reading. love you all  deb,1
 I really don't know what to do. I have no reason to be sad but I am. It seems like more and more I want to cry. I have a boyfriend and a loving mother but I still cry myself to sleep at night. I go to church and I'm not good in school but for the most part I enjoy going. Please help. I don't know what to do. My mom says I have mood swings and I've noticed that I can go from laughing one second to crying the next. I'm 15 and I just really need someone to explain how I'm feeling to me. ,1
 I'll first tell you what happened just in case no one read the previous posts about it.  well I went camping with a friend I didn't want to go and I hate her ..  I had a bit of alcohol and started passing out and my friend started touching me .. etc. I feel sick every time I see her and fail to face her anytime I know she's near.  I confided in my 2 closest friends but one of them don't understand at all. she says I have to face my fears when I see her in school and dread walking past her or near her. My friend doesn't realize that I feel physically sick and shaky when I'm near her.  I just can't explain to her that it's not a phobia like spiders or what ever she truly annoys me and I don't know what to do. ,1
" I'm new to these boards and I hope I'm posting in the right spot...I have been diagnosed with major recurring depression since 1992. I have a host of chronic  painful auto-immune related diseases. I am also trying to care for an ill family member who just got out of the hospital and had major surgery (takes a year to recover from this surgery). This family member is pretty much bedridden and needs to be bathed  fed  and cared for much the way a private duty nurse would. It is a daunting task for me under the circumstances. Insurance will not pay for long term care and we cannot afford even the cheapest of help. Hence  I am managing all of it alone. Once in a blue moon  my in-laws will help but are very resentful on the rare occasion that I ask for help. My house is cluttered (I saw that topic) and I'm not sure if its because I'm so depressed or because I have been sick too much to take care of it. I think perhaps its both. I know that at least some of my depression is situational  but I also know that some of it is not. I am on medication  but the medicines have never done a whole lot for me. I've tried them all. I was found to be ""resistant"" to medication. Whatever that means. I was hospitalized for a 3 month period in the 1990's for suicide attempts. I guess what brought me here is that I feel like I'm about to ""crack"" and am trying to find a way to avoid that. I am hoping to get past this pain caused by this disease I have so that I can get the energy back that I need to unclutter my house  have a genuine smile on my face when handling my nursing duties and get a hold on my life in general.",1
" Isn't love great? When my daughter was younger she wanted to marriage her daddy of course (doesn't all little girls want to do that). Before she started school  when she was in daycare centre  she had like 5 boys or so she was ""dating"". After that she has not mentioned anything about boys being pretty or so in school  until....she married our rabbit! lmao. Yes you heard me  she had a couple of friends here and they had a wedding ceremony. I guess she got tired of it cause after that she likes somebody new. Like every girl in her age she fell in love with a famous one  a singer. (When i was her age i was in love with a hockey player but that's a different story).This is him: Darin!. Was in Swedish Idol. Psstt  she's over him now. My daughter is so cute i love you :)",1
 I feel like a bit of a jerk posting here when I haven't been around to support any of you  so I hope someone out there is feeling generous tonight.  My background story consists on being depressed on and off for the past 12 years or so  I am now 20. Finally started antidepressants in October. By December the side effects were not stopping and I stopped taking them because I always felt sick to my stomach .... and a person can't work that way. So I stopped them .... I have not been to the doctor since and have been feeling on top of the world.  Even my co-workers have noticed a big difference and my manager has been giving me a lot of opportunity at work (training new hires  being on committees etc)  But ....  then today hit . like a ton of bricks to the head.  I'm tired  cranky  I cant stop crying and am trying very hard not to cut myself. I hate everything and am just beside myself.  I don't know what to do. I have the energy from when i felt great but I feel like crud and have no where to constructively place this energy.  I don't think I can go back to my doctor ..... she'll just tell me to take the drugs and stop whining.  I'm not so sure I'm depressed. Maybe I'm normal and it's the rest of the world messed up? That's a whole other story though.  Can anyone here honestly say that medications work and you can be a functional person? I mean ... will this ever end so I can get some peace?  Any opinions or insight would be appreciated. ,1
" Hi there. My name is Tim  I am 38 years old and live in the UK. I have been prescribed 40mg of paroxetine  but stopped taking it a couple of months ago as it wasn't helping me in my situation  which has probably made me physically worse. My depression probably stems from low self esteem and the feeling of general failure. I have suffered for 19 years now  not constantly  as ""success"" at work can suppress it (i.e. times when I feel I am contributing something). To the outside world I probably appear relatively ""normal"" I have to stop now as I need to go out  I'll try and articulate where I am coming from later",1
" Here's my story  however dull and blunt it may be ...  High school was great. Lots of fun You know-  Parties  beer  dates  sports and the works. I was never what one would call popular  however  I was respected by nearly everyone I went to school with. This  I feel was an asset of mine and helped me with self confidence as well as developing as a individual.  I'm now 19 (20 in June) and have no job  no money  don't go to school and have LITERALLY no friends  aside from my parents whom I still live with a leach off of (what a joke). I am virtually reclusive in my home with the occasional outing to buy cigarettes and to visit my Grandmother who is well near her deathbed.  I suppose my past bout with drugs may be a co - culprit influencing me to work in 'close to' complete isolation.  Maybe there is a cure for me but  chances are it isn't natural remedy. My addictive personality and past drug experiences has veered me away from trying the latest depression medications or any for that matter.  This condition of mine  whatever the fuck it is  started developing slowly. I would avoid large social gatherings at first  then I would pretty much steer clear of meeting with friends (even the closest of friends)  and finally I wouldn't even take phone calls. At this point it's all of the above.  When I do confront a person  which by all means I try to avoid  I can't for the life of me keep eye contact like I used to and I seem like a complete  uninterested asshole who is simply in a rush and has no time for chat.  For instance  a two old friends of mine from high school stopped by at my house today to catch up on things. When asked what I was up to I looked at the ground and replied  ""Well ... I'm [pathetic excuse of a lie goes here] ...."" Nobody buys my shit. If I don't believe myself how can anyone else.?  So  here I am today. The table has turned. I am now the chump. The one without any respect OR self respect and the guy who respects anyone who isn't as lowly as myself. And I hate myself for it. It isn't as if I had a rough upbringing. My parents are and were loving  I've had so many friends  all the opportunities in the world. And I waste it all and continue to do so every stinking day of my life.  I'm not looking for sympathy. It actually matters little if nobody reads this at all. I just needed to put my thoughts somewhere I could come back to re - read and contemplate them ",1

 Hi My name is Tracy  I am 44 years old and have three children 4 8 and 11  I've been going through something lately I wake up in the morning and its like I'm in a different world. I cry about everything. I look at pictures of my kids when they were younger and I burst into tears. I have nothing to be depressed about   good wife  good kids  good job  I don't understand what's going on. This is totally out of my character. Now it's getting to the point to where I don't want to go to work on night shifts because I'm afraid something will happen to them while I'm at work. Also when I have to sleep during the day I have trouble falling to sleep Its like I'm scared to sleep. I have also wake up from a deep sleep with panic attacks  I have learned how to talk myself out of them. Everything is so emotional it's like I'm morning the death of one of my children. Any way its driving me and my wife crazy  Its not all the time it comes and goes  other times I am fine. My wife says I'm so much more loving toward my family when I'm going through this. I am on zoloft per family doctor. But it don't seem to help. I also have sleep apnea which I read can cause depression. Well if anybody Knows what I'm going through please respond  I don't know if its depression or some kind of sleep problem. Thanks for listening,1
" I am screaming inside. I want to cry. My eyes are burning  ready to cry. At least it's something... A feeling. It has taken me so much time to work up the courage to call a psychiatrist. I told myself no matter how I am feeling I am going to call. I researched and found who's supposed to be the best. I called and was referred to a local chapter; not taking new patients. They referred me to a place where the psychiatrist isn't taking new patients but the psychologists are. They asked me what kind of treatment I needed!! ""Do you need a therapist or do you need a psychiatrist"" All of this was after I worked so hard explaining my life long depression with and without circumstantial reasons. I AM NOT THE DOCTOR. HOW DO I KNOW WHAT I NEED!! BOTH!!! I set the appt  but I think I need access to both a therapist and a psychiatrist. I canceled  and I feel so horrible. Don't they know how hard it was for me to call? I am upset right now. I want to give up  but I know I will have to call someone else. Why does it have to be so hard?",1
 I am new here today. I believe I have been suffering from depression since I was a late teen. I am now 42  run my own business and just started Prozac late December & seeing a psychologist in late Nov. I do not feel any better but it is a relief just knowing that you are doing something other than trying to ignore a definite but unexplainable problem. I suffer from severe anxiety  fall asleep fine but wake up at 2.00 am with my mind racing a million miles a minute  mostly about work. This anxiety and depression has definitely affected my relationship with my wife & kids. Most times when you're at work you want to be home & vice versa  really don't know what you want. I do not feel like talking to anyone & have cut off most of my good friends. I understand most men do not want to admit they have a problem until their wife leaves them and it's too late. I am happy that is not the case with me. I just hope the medication kicks in soon so I can see what it feels like to be normal if that is possible. Thanks for letting me ramble,1
" My weight is ballooning out of control.  I take daily:  40 MG of Prozac (in the morning);  1 MG Klonopin (same time): 1 MG Klonopin (5 PM) 1 MG Klonopin (bedtime)  prescribed by a psychiatrist.  I also take 1000 MG Keppra at bedtime for migraine prevention (prescribed by a neurologist).  I've been on various combinations of these for a couple of years.  The psychiatrist is doggedly insistent that the medications I'm on shouldn't be making me gain weight - but nonetheless they are.  I've had other medications that have given me side effects that I ""shouldn't"" have had - but nonetheless I do.  I have read many  many stories on the internet and through direct conversation with others that say they have had exactly the same things happen with SSRI's.  When I've asked him to change the medication  he keeps preaching ""diet and exercise"".  It hasn't worked.  I'm now down to the point where I eat virtually nothing and today I exercised to the point where I nearly blacked out.  This is causing problems between my wife and I (she also sees the same psychiatrist and takes Klonopin and Effexor)  not least because I have no sexual desire.  None.  She sees him (the psychiatrist) tomorrow but I don't see him until April 6.  Yesterday in my therapy session I had an angry outburst that maybe I should just quit taking all the medication (because maybe I'm over medicated) and she didn't like that too much.  Am I going to have to die of obesity or over exercise to get his attention?  What do I have to do to convince them?  This is not helping my depression any when I can't stand to even look at myself in the mirror. ",1
 Hi I am Tracy and I have had depression and anxiety for about 10years.I am 35 and a wife and mum to 3 beautiful kids who deserve a mum who isn't ill. The biggest thing that gets me so frustrated with myself is the way depression makes me feel such a weak person  before I was ill I had a job  was the strong one where friends and family were concerned and basically could cope with whatever life threw at me .Now I am lucky if I can cope with getting through the day. I am on Efexor xl at the moment and have been for about a year. It is so nice to post this and not worry about being judged  it is lovely to know that other people understand. Well that's me,1
 Poor Spring. He tries so hard but sometimes things don't work despite best laid plans. His ex wife is doing 'something' almost every weekend in August and September. So his plan to take me away have dissolved. Thing is... I kind of think it's a tad bit of not wanting to see him happy. Ex's are so hard to deal with. Look at me and Cretin. He still continues to make our lives a misery on every given occasion. Wait until he finds out I have a boyfriend. It'll be 50 questions as to who he is  his family heritage and down to whether we have depraved sexual practices in front of the girls. I also really detest his girlfriend... Mainly because of the times she's upset the kids. It's not the kids fault. I feel like Small Spring is caught in the middle a little bit and won't have him made to feel bad in any way. So we aren't going away in the way we'd planned.... We're trying to snatch a night in July maybe? We'll see  no pressure. It's meant to be fun not a trial. There's always the turkey and tinsel fun weekends at Christmas. I can wear tinsel in strategic places and feel MUCH more relaxed ;) I feel good tonight. I like being able to take control and understand stuff. Rise above the crap. Oh cat worries..... Taylor has a limp. He's ALWAYS got something going on. Probably fighting with the neighbors with the 6 England flags (still up) scabby cats. Bailey has brought in yet another huge Moth. I am the moth rescuer in this place. Plus I'm longing for a new kitten.,1
 I have been in two accidents one in October (went to take pictures of my sister in the parade  she was nominated for homecoming queen)  and one in February. The first accident really messed not only my mind  but my body up. Now I am 23  and have severe back  shoulder  and knee pain that I have been treated for  and other pain that I just refuse to go to the doctor for (all from the first accident). I have done the specialist thing  and physical therapy. Nothing has made me feel better other than temporarily (if all I do physically is nothing). I can't work  clean  or do anything I enjoy without it making the pain worse. I am at my witsi end. I am in the deepest hole I have ever been in. I can't take having to choose between mental stability  and physical stability anymore. Some days I wonder why I even get out of bed. Nothing good comes out of it. I would give anything in the world to feel better. Last night I just cried myself to sleep  because I am not the only person dealing with this. I take my emotions out on everyone around me including my husband. Lately I can't help  but think he deserves better. I suppose I don't think I know. Sorry for ranting like this  but I just needed to get all of this out of my head. I thought if it wasn't in there it wouldn't bother me so much.,1
" Hi everybody! I'm new here and I want to tell my story in brief and ask you a few questions. I'm 27 now. Female. I'm studying on PhD in one of the US universities. I've been suffering from different kinds of psychological problems (mainly  depression) for 7 years already. I always tried to handle my depression by myself. And only once  when depression became unbearable  I went to psychiatrist. I had therapy and AD for a few months. That was about 5-51/2 years ago. Now I have strong depression again. I feel that I can't handle it by myself and that I'm tired of fighting it on my own. That's why I've scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist. My questions: 1. I feel that this depression is different from depressions I experienced before :I started to masturbate like crazy (4-5 times a day) and can't stop - it has been like this for a few weeks already and I seriously started to think about involving  in some homosexual relationship (which I've never done before). I also started to read a lot of porno stories. 2. I'm thinking almost constantly about suicide. I mean  I don't think about committing suicide. NO. I WANT TO LIVE. It's kind of obsessive thought playing in my mind: ""I feel bad ...suicide...many people do that...suicide"". It's kind of always in my mind. Sometimes I even have a feeling of the rope on my neck (I don't think about other kinds of suicide which is  probably  explained by the fact that my father hung himself). 3. Where am I going guys? Am I going to some serious psycho disease or what? Am I still normal (I feel like I'm still normal). Have you ever experienced something like this? Honestly  what I'm afraid of is that at some point I might start seriously consider these suicidal thoughts. I think this is what happened to my dad. 4. I've been here  in the US  only for 1 year. So  I don't know how the system works. If I come to a psychiatrist and tell her that I have these ""suicidal"" thoughts will she make me to be in the hospital (I hate even think about this). Should I even tell her about that? Should I be very honest and open? When I went to our University Health Center to get a referral form  I didn't say anything about that. So  I'm a bit afraid of trusting a psychiatrist. Maybe  I don't need to tell her everything. What would be your advice? I'd greatly appreciate your help. Thanks.",1
 Ok I have a couple of questions...I guess. 1st is I finally managed to make myself an appointment with a psychiatrist (it's not till May). Now I'm having second thoughts about it. I just pretty much want to go in for an evaluation (to see if there is a problem) and see if maybe there is a short term solution for the suicidal thoughts I've been having. I've got a summer job I'm leaving for in June and than I'm moving to another city after that. (So basically something till I'm stable with where I'm living and job). I assume I'm only going to be able to see 1 doctor  1 time before than. So 2nd thoughts have been should I just wait to see someone when I actually get settled. Also if a psychiatrist is who I want to see (I've never been to anyone before for my mental health)...that's what the intake coordinator suggested. Also I was wondering if they could hospitalize you for suicidal thoughts without your permission? Ok now on to the suicidal thoughts questions (and just so people know I do not feel myself to be in any immediate or near immediate danger to myself). One main thing is does depression have to be present for suicidal thoughts/actions? I often find my mind turns more to thoughts of suicide and death when I feel relatively normal mood wise. And that when I have feel really depressed the thought of suicide rarely crosses my mind (but the pain is more severe). I guess that's really all I have. Sorry if the topic is inappropriate for this forum. I just wanted to ask...and maybe discuss with someone...but don't really feel that it's a problem for me right now. If someone wants to talk in PMs I wouldn't mind either.,1
 I'm sort of new... Here is the short version: I'm 26 year old man. Single. No kids. I live in Arizona (USA). My father was a workaholic  and an alcoholic. So usually he wasn't present  and when he was he was abusive. In addition  mental illness runs in my family. At the age of 5 I was sexually molested by a neighbor. I can recall my anxiety always being there. It's something I have always fought with especially in social situations. My family completely isolated me when I was growing up  in the name of protecting me. As a result I never really learned social skills until I was older. I grew up being abused by my peers throughout school. Found myself taken in by the only people who would accept me as I was: the misfits  outcasts  drug-users. Early into my teen years depression came as an addition to my anxiety. Around 16 I started to get into substance abuse. The only thing I ever used was LSD on weekends regularly. A year later this extended into ecstasy and LSD. I had a traumatic experience and stopped using anything about a year after that. My anxiety became so overwhelming I could not function. So at this time I first started seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist. They put me on Clonzepam. My last year in high school my father was starting to lose it so my mother asked me to leave so we didn't kill each other. I had an inheritance from another relative and I lived off that. I went 2 whole years without speaking to my father. I sunk deep into depression  and returned to substance abuse. The Clonzepam wasn't working anymore. After being outcast from my family  I went full on into the dark side. What was just LSD and ecstasy usage branched into cocaine  meth  marijuana  and virtually anything my friends and I could find. This culminated in an extreme suicide attempt about a year out of high school. After getting out of the mental hospital  I went totally straight and haven't touched any drugs since then. The 8 years following have been a rollercoaster. One moment being on top of the world  having everything I could ever want. Another losing everything. Several long horrible relationships occurred in this time. Over the years my doctor has moved me around on various medicines. I have been using Effexor since 1998. Currenlty I take Lamictal in addition to it. I suffer from chronic reoccurring depression  social phobia  and generalized anxiety disorder.,1
 I have had borderline personality disorder since I was a little kid. Although then the therapist said it was Bipolar Disorder and ADHD. Since then I have been on pretty much every medication you can imagine and even sent to a temporary mental hospital. It isn't until now that I self diagnosed myself with BPD. I don't even think my doctor really thinks I have that although considering all the research I have done I fit the description perfectly. Since the age of 13 I was being self destructive by slamming my head in the was during times of stress. The first time I starting cutting was when I was 21. This was after an ex boyfriend left me. We had only been dating for 3 months. Sad huh. This went on sporadically for about a year and a half (during that time I committed myself). Finally I started dating my next boyfriend. He told me if I didn't stop cutting he would leave me. I stopped. We dated 2 years and then broke up. I am now 27 and married to another man who is 12 years older than me. We have been married almost a year (together for 3.5 years) and about 3 months ago I started cutting again. This time it is 3 times worse and I can't seem to stop. I am covered in scars and I have even gone as far as cutting the inside of my wrist. I am currently on Wellbutrin which does seem to be working (I do have a lot of good days). Although since I started to become depressed again I have been having a hard time dealing with the fact that my husband has a son. It didn't bother me as much (just a little) before because I did my best to stay busy. Since I got married I lost all my friends and now spend every other weekend alone. Mostly in bed. I never had to play mom before so I never thought I would ever be in the position to  so I just stayed out of the way. Plus  his son doesn't like me being around. Which makes me feel worse. In my state of mind I can't deal with that. My alone time is when I cut the most. My husband and I are in therapy  my therapist wants us to work. I am not so sure I can stay with him. Although I am having a hard time leaving. I am just so tired of feeling so alone all the time and he is just not capable of being there for me. This puts extra stress on him and I don't want that. Plus  it is my fault I married him  I knew he had a kid. I guess I didn't know I would get bad again. Last week we talked about me leaving. He ran upstairs and cried (he said he will fight for me) I went straight for the exacto knife. I had suicide in mind although I see myself as a wimp in that area which makes me feel even worse about myself. I cut 5 times on the inside of my wrist but I guess not deep enough. He came down and found me. My antidepressants work almost 80% of the time but whenever I think of losing my husband I get sad and hopeless. Every time I think of staying with him and feeling the way I do all the time I get sad and hopeless. I feel cornered. Cutting make it all feel better  suicide sounds comforting. If anyone can relate or has any good advice I am welcome to it.,1
 I am a 21 year old male  who has been depressed for about two years  ever since I moved to GA from New York. I have social anxiety  and I am a victim of child sex abuse. I have no friends in this state because I was raised in a minority neighborhood  but in this state  there are only a few. Even in New York  I only have two friends  one who has not talked to me since I moved here. There is nothing worth doing or seeing in this place. There are no buses  trains  malls  sidewalks  coliseums  etc ... I am losing my mind. I do not do anything but go online and watch tv all day. Where is the chat room for this site? I clicked Join Live Chat  thinking it was a real chat room.,1
" I was just reading back over the past few entries. I have been in tough shape and I didn't realize how tough until I read it over. The depression  the arthritis  and the circumstances of my life all have been conspiring to keep me down.  My therapist was right  I think  when she said on Monday that I needed sometime to just ""be"". I've stopped answering my phone and have spend most of the past few days watching DVDs  playing computer games and resting my sore body. I feel better emotionally since I have been doing this. I wish I didn't feel so horribly guilty for checking out of the world for a few days  but I'm willing to cope with it if it makes ma feel a little better. The other thing I am feeling guilty about is this training I am supposed to go to in Washington  DC in two weeks. I feel like if I go I will be letter all sorts of people down at work. I have even contacted the people running the training and asked if I can delay it  but it is now or never and since it is all expenses paid in Washington for three days if I pass it up at the last minute I am screwing someone else out of the opportunity. If I go or if I don't go I am going to feel guilty and selfish. I'm not going to decide now though.  I am just going to keep up with the resting for another day.",1
 My doctor diagnosed me with depression (mild form) possibly situational. I have been off work for the past month as a result of a culmination of stressful events over the past year or so. Such as my husband's alcoholism  having a child (she is 18 months now) and returning to work. My doctor put me on Effexor 37.5 mg which has since increased to 75 mg. As a result I have had insomnia for past three weeks  I will try to take it before bedtime now as I was taking it in the morning  but I can sleep during the day but not at night??? My Supervisor did not want me returning to work while experiencing side effects ... the insomnia  nausea  dizziness  etc. I applied for short term disability and received a letter today stating I am not eligible for benefits based on diagnosis of depression and being put on medication!!!! Talk about depressing!!! oh  wait  I already was I have very low motivation  I don't feel like socializing or talking to anyone and some days I don't even want to go out of the house. I have to get up everyday though as I have to care for my daughter while husband works  even when I was working it was still me caring for our daughter and doing everything else around the house ... yes  I am resentful too. I have no thoughts of self harm or suicide  just very negative and unhappy all the time. I have found that the Effexor has made me more relaxed   less anxious and less irritable. But the insomnia is horrible  I was having interrupted sleep before being put on medication and really wanted something that would help me sleep ... rrhmmm. Is anyone else on Effexor and find it beneficial for them. Just wanted to introduce myself and hear from others.,1
" I feel like holding in my anger.... or at least trying to be NICE all the time contributes to me feeling depressed. Maybe it's a good thing you're experiencing anger  maybe you deserve to express those ""negative"" emotions  of course without hurting anyone.... I wonder how much my not feeling worthy or feeling powerless contributes to not speaking up & holding in angry feelings and in a vicious cycle my depression will feed off feeling powerless or undeserving and create even more feelings of worthlessness.... VICIOUS CYCLE!!!! Because  feel like I don't have very good boundaries & am not nearly assertive enough when I need to tell people what I NEED & what I WANT... then my resentment & anger build up... I have definite triggers that make me so angry (especially my husband) I wish I could beat the s*** out of him.... under it I'm just so F***ing HURT!!!! And if I can get in touch with the hurt I can express it some how... cry  write  something..... And of course he can hear me better when I am sharing my ""being hurti vs. Screaming & throwing things...",1
 Well I bought the TENS machine. got it set up earlier and decided I was in SO much pain across my shoulders that I would set it at the neck shoulder setting and on the MOST intense setting due to the pain and the desperation I was feeling. Well that was a mistake it's like being stabbed with a pointy stick - so I reset it to the minimum setting. it has helped a little perhaps I should use it more often to a) get used to the feeling b) get rid of the pain as I am in LESS pain now but it hasn't gone altogether would I recommend one let's just say I need a few more days to decide but for now I am in slightly less pain than I was,1
 I feel really bad for not coming to the forum much last week. i have been in turmoil. Things at home are not going well at all. My husband got his new house and is moving in the next few weeks ... incidentally that is not the problem. I am happy that he is leaving. He has been a real jerk lately. He says mean things to me and he is angry all of the time. He has been working on the road for the past month so we only have to tolerate each other on the weekends  - thank goodness. When he comes home the first thing that he does is go up to the computer room and say hi to his buddies ... not to me and not to our son (in fact he only spend a total of one hour with our son on the weekends). When he finally graces us with his presence he just complains. I did SO much work around the house last week - I cut the grass  weeded the garden  watered the lawn everyday  vacuumed the house from top to bottom  washed the floors on the main floor of the house  did all of the laundry  patched some dents in the walls and painted them  cleaned out our son's room .... and still he managed to find things that were 'wrong'. He even had the audacity to tell me that I am a pig and nothing gets done around here. I just can't take it anymore. All he does is get angry and complain. I finally realized this weekend that I am not his problem. He is just using me as an excuse. I have tried to talk to him and all he wants to do is play the blame game. We have agreed to not see each other for the month of august so that each of us can decide what it is that we want to do regarding our relationship. Even that ticked him off. When I asked him if he would like me to send our son with his parents when they come to visit him he got mad that I wasn't going to come see him. The 'no seeing each other in August' was entirely his idea. I have no clue what is going on in his head. I have tried and tried to talk to him and the only reply I get is defensive or aggressive. I am at my wits' end and am about to give up. I care very much for him and I know that there is something wrong but I cannot help him. I am so afraid of giving up on us though because I am riddled with the 'what ifs'. I want a family so bad. am I settling though? I hate saying that because my husband is not a terrible man. He has his finer qualities it is just that lately they are few and far between. He has even told me that he would cheat on me if given the chance. And that he might have while drunk one night and that the girl has told other people that the baby she is carrying might be his. You know the more that I write the more I feel like an idiot. What a fucking doormat. What the hell am I doing? i am putting my happiness and wellbeing on the back burner for someone who has told me repeatedly that he no longer loves me and thinks that he has had an affair (or at the least would like to). How pathetic can you get. What a glutton for punishment I am. Why is it that I feel that he is more important than me? You know I thought that I was doing better on the medication - I might not be having the emotional outbursts but I still have the low - or should I say non-existent self esteem. If only all of this could be over. If only he could either WAKE up and figure out what he wants to do or just fuck off and never see me or our son again. That would make my life so much easier. I fear for my son. I do not want my husband's anger to hurt our son. I don't want husband to take out his frustrations on a two year old. I worry about sending our son to visit him. Without me there or the dogs  xxxx is the only one there to take the abuse. Anyway that is what I have been dealing with the past week. As a result of all of this I have been on a self destruct mode. I have not been sleeping  i have been late for work and I have been unprepared many times. I am glad that the last day is this Thursday. i will have a month to 'detox'. I need it. ,1
" I have been so depressed over a lost friendship. I have known this girl for about 5 years. We were very close or so I thought. We both had boys around the same age  went on vacations together with our families  and both went through our 2nd pregnancy together. I knew she was a person that had to have things her way but I accepted this. She has a large circle of friends that she included me in. I felt her family was mine  in a way. I am very shy and came out of my shell. Last year I got caught up with 2 other friends that were having problems. They really needed me. So I wasn't around much but I am always available if she needed me. Anyway  we got into a misunderstanding over something very minor. I really didn't think much about it the next day. That is the way I am. I get mad then I am over it within 24 hours. She is not like that. She holds grudges. I saw her the next day (4th of July) at her house. I knew she didn't really talk to me but she did have a lot of people there. Well a couple of weeks after I call her saying ""Hey girl  can I pick land on up?"". She said ""How can you call and act like nothing is wrong?"" Then she hangs up on me. I wait until the next day and called again. First thing she says is ""What do you want?"" I say ""Just to be your friend."" She says ""We are no longer friends. There will be no more double dating with our husbands  vacations  you are to not come to my house  We are not friends"". I was blown away. I asked what I did and she couldn't give me a direct answer. She said we had different friends and I had more drama than any of her friends of 20 years. I asked her what drama? Last year I had some problems with my husband but I didn't really talk to her about that. She said  that was a problem  I didn't tell her things and that is what friends do. WHAT? She was contradicting herself. She hung up on me again.  It is very difficult for me because when I make a friend and let them into my heart they are my friend for life. Her son is my son's best friend and her husband is my husbands best friend. I had recently told my husband to not mention their names around me because I become really depressed. My poor son doesn't understand why she doesn't like me anymore. How can I explain when I don't know. I bought her daughter a shirt about a month ago and she didn't acknowledge it until she saw me in Walmart a week later and we were face to face and she thanked me. It was very weird. I haven't seen her since July. I can't let my son have his friend over anymore because it hurts too much to see him and know that I am not welcomed in their home and they haven't asked my son over their house since all of this even though he still came over ours. I can't figure out what I did that was so bad. I wish I knew so that maybe I could at least defend myself and have some closure. ",1
 My purpose for posting this is that I'm at a dead end and don't know where else to turn. I'm 39 and I'm sure have been suffering from depression most my whole life. My life has been one failure after another  in relationships  jobs  and anything else. I had been on antidepressants for about 10 years and then stopped after I got arrested for a DUI and felony hit and run. The man who was injured received a cut on his face after chasing after me when I split the scene  that was the whole extent of his injuries. After the arrest I was feeling so bad it made no difference whether I took them or not. The charges were dropped but I had to wait day after day for a year or more just waiting for them to recharge me  which my attorney was sure they were going to do. That was 2 years ago and I think the experience did some very serious and real damage to me. I just lost my job in my probationary period of 2 months. I have worked so hard to create some kind of financial security for myself (BA in Psychology  technical degree in computers  numerous computer certifications) but where ever I go I don't fit in to the group and find myself alienated and let go. Some many failed romantic relationships  never having friends  and what family members I have are abusive and are incapable of providing healthy support. Most nights I calm myself enough to fall asleep by fantasizing about killing myself and the relief that was provide. I feel like a freak physically. I shortened my fingers on my right hand by 1/2 inch and my hand is deformed because I hit the wall in my apartment one night about 4 years ago after I was let go from a job and my girlfriend broke up with me at the same time.  Of course what I have stated so far isn't close to all that is weighing on me.  Now I am just so tired and hopeless I don't know how to get the energy to try again. Any encouragement or wisdom the read / you can provide is very much appreciated. If you need to something that is hurtful please don't respond to this. ,1
" I'm sitting here at what is my 26th or 27th job (I can barely keep count. I'm 27 years old by the way). I already hate it and I've been here one month today. I don't think it's normal to have this many jobs over a lifetime  let alone when you're just in your late 20's. I've applied for disability before but was denied. I don't dispute the fact that I can get a job  I just can't keep a job. I get bored  I get anxiety attacks  I get to the point where I don't want to go outside at all. I'll never be able to work (successfully) with all those things going on. When I went to see an attorney to appeal my disability decision  he said I should find a job with minimal responsibility. What kind of job is that? Don't you have to be responsible enough to at least come to work (and on time)? Don't you have to be responsible to follow the rules of the job? I can't seem to do either one. Each job I get  I think ""maybe this can be the job I can stay at"" and it never happens. The longest I've ever stayed at a job is 1 year. I just feel like such a loser. Everyone I know always says they'll do whatever kind of job for their kids  or I should be lucky to have a job. I can see their point  but when I feel so miserable I can't see past that. I drag myself to jobs only to end up quitting or getting myself fired. What's wrong with me? Any advice? Anyone?",1
"  Hi  everyone - new to these forum board thingies so please forgive me if this does not end up being posted in the right place! I have lived with depression since I was 14 years old (I am now 43). For the past 10 years I have been managing this condition without the aid of drugs or stimulants. My life changed the day I stopped fighting the ""condition"" and accepted it as part of who I was. Acceptance is the greatest gift you can give yourself on the road to recovery  not only does it take away the stigma  it also gives the fear nothing to feed on. For those of you who are still in the depths of darkness  please don't give up hope  there are many of us out here who  have experienced exactly what you are going through now  we survived - so can you. Recovery is possible  it just takes time and a little faith in yourself. Thank you for allowing me to join this community  I hope my experiences of living with this condition can help others  the door to the email box is always open! Kindest regards to all",1
 having just cheated on a girl i've known for over 3 years  i have felt not only depressed  but also physically sick from the moment i got on the train home at the weekend. i am incapable of vomiting because i have a stomach ulcer from 4 years ago as a result of depression at a previous job. i have repeatedly apologized profusely to her  and today was told that she would not be able to see me before she leaves to go back abroad. i can only hope at this stage that she will contact me when she returns to the uk. the worst part is that i don't seem to have a reason for going with the other girl.,1
 Thank You ArtChick and Tempesta   all of you who have been here for me. I'm so glad that you all understand. I really want to get out from behind this trapped door. My life is so controlled and he doesn't even see it. He denies it when i bring it up. I cry because i can't buy things for my children or grandchildren. This isn't the way it is suppose to be. One of the reasons I don't make it to church on some Sundays is because I don't have clothes to wear. I have a pair of black jeans i keep switching jackets and shirts so i don't look the same every Sunday. My daughter bought me a nice dress and it was warm enough last Sunday to wear it. I guess i shouldn't care about what people think and all the people at my church are wonderful  not judgmental. I do go to the Lord in Prayer every morning and study my Bible. I feel content because we are supposed to give all our worries to him and not get in his way of taking care of them. I know God is working in my life  my daughter finding this site is just one of the ways i know. my husband just got a job after being out of work for a year. I prayed for that too. He didn't just get a job but he got a good job. I told him he didn't get it on his own. I know I am going to get better eventually. Thank all of you for being here for me. I will keep all of you in my prayers too.,1
 I suffer from major depression too and I have taken almost all of the SSRI's but the only one that really helped me was Lexapro. I took it for around 2 month's  then decided that I didn't want to become addicted to another medication so I just stopped taking it and it didn't bother me at all. I have been taking 100 mil of Elavil at bedtime which is also an antidepressant but I take it to help me sleep. It used to help control my depression but it doesn't anymore and really doesn't help me sleep either. Have you ever tried Lexapro? I think it's the best SSRI one can be on and I had no side effects while taking it so you might want to ask your doctor about it. If there is an alternative treatment for major depression I would like to know what it is. I really have no reason to be depressed as I have a very loving  supportive husband 4 wonderful children  10 grandchildren and 6 great-grand children. Both my husband and I are retired and this is a time when I should really be enjoying my life but there is a void which I can't explain. I don't want for anything. I have a beautiful home  a new Durango but the material things aren't what makes one happy. I've been told that one chooses to be happy or unhappy but I certainly don't choose to be unhappy and I don't know anyone who would. I am a devout Christian and I know that my depression isn't coming from God but I'm letting the Devil tell me that I'm depressed. Maybe God is just trying to bring me closer to Him and I need to lay my burden of depression at His feet and tell him that I can't get through this alone  then just forget about it but for me it isn't that easy. Three of my 4 children are taking antidepressants so I guess depression might be hereditary (spelling?). I will pray for you to feel better and will you please pray for me too? Thank you.,1
 I'm new to this board. I've been on State Disability for severe depression since March. Sometime during the summer - can't remember exactly when - I was sent for a psychiatric evaluation. Even though I told the doctor I was still suicidal  sleeping 18 hours or not at all  bulimic  and in danger of eviction because I couldn't manage running a household  she determined I was well enough to go back to work. I have been under psychiatric care for depression for about 12 years now. This is NOT going away. I have been trying to finish my Social Security application since March but it's too overwhelming. I should have it ready this week. Does anyone have any experience with appeals at the state (California) level? Btw  I did lose my apartment and had to send my son to live in Texas with my mother since I was on the verge of homelessness. I spend all day paralyzed with fear. Help.,1
 Hello. I am just getting over a suicide attempt  my 2nd. It was extremely serious. I was planning it for week  and when I was fired form my job I did it the next day. I have a BS in chemistry and worked testing pharmacological products  so i knew what to take. I don't know what made me call my ex-BF. I did not speak to him for 4 months  but I wanted him to be the one to find me. Needless to say I lived. The doctors where surprised that I did. I took 3 things  (not going to give people ideas) that i knew they could not do anything for because of them being together. They could not pump my stomach cause of the one thing. They could not give any antidotes cause of interactions. I took well over the lethal limit. My life was spiraling out of control since Jan of 98. Since then  I have had 3 heart and 2 cancer operations. I was discharged from the Navy  was an officer  because of the medical stuff. My 1st suicide attempt was in the navy  they chalked it up to being stupid and not dealing with the 1st heart and cancer surgeries. My parents had a bitter divorce and I was caught in the middle when I got home. My mother assumed my ID and ran up a bunch of bills. I came out of the closet. I slept around to feel wanted. Which was not a wise choice  I gained my 3rd major medical situation. Not going to say what  but I am sure you can figure it out. I have a soul mate that I hurt  my ex-BF  and who knows if we will ever be friends or more. 2005 was a blur. I do not remember things  or saw things that where not there. Like documentation  which led to me being fired. I was afraid to leave the house  and was even afraid of 5 year olds selling candy for the school. The good thing about the suicide attempt is there was a proper diagnosis. I compartmentalized  and pushed emotions away. Every situation or moment had its own little box  and I put it away. I wanted to be like Spok or Data. I would put on different mask for different situations. There was shopping me  gas pumping me  heck  i had a separate mask for every action I performed. I have abandonment issues  from how i was treated growing up. Medicines did nothing and gave bad side effects. My depression is not chemical  but mental. I need to re-learn how to think and handle emotions and issues properly. Unemployment is running out  people are looking for money for bills. But it is better to be alive. WOW  this was longer than I intended. Just saying who I am  and I am a mess.....but slowly putting my life together.,1
" I had therapy today. I don't even know where to start. First off  I lost a day last week (time loss/dissociation)...it was last Tuesday that I lost. My mom called me Friday and I said ""why are you calling me"" and she said ""I always call you on Friday"". I told her that it was Thursday and she told me I was wrong. So  I back tracked the best I could and I can't remember anything that I did on Tuesday. The interesting thing is that I mailed my therapist the research info I found on dissociation so when I saw her today I asked her what was the date that I put on the letter I sent and guess what...IT WAS TUESDAY. Then she asked me if I brought it in and I told her no that I mailed it. And she said that I couldn't have because it wasn't scanned by the post office. She showed me the envelope and it wasn't scanned at all. She also said that the mail had already come in the office and the envelope was in her mailbox way after she had already checked her mail. So  we have no idea how that got to her office. But I don't drive and Carol didn't take me anywhere last week. So  if anyone remembers being with me or talking to me Tuesday...COULD YOU HELP ME OUT PLEASE. My therapist looked over the information that I sent her and she said that everything basically fits with what I'm going through and DID. The problem is  she doesn't treat dissociative disorders and has no idea how to even help me. I appreciated her honesty though. But she said she knows a therapist in Jeffersonville  IN...oh God...that treats dissociative patients but I don't drive and Carol's not going to take me over to Jville on a weekly basis for therapy. Also  we've never even been over there before so we'd get lost. So  she then called her boss and another lady to see if they knew who else in Louisville could help me and to see if she can get some help on treating me. I also gave her more info on some of the things I'm dealing with and the voices that are going on. I even gave her the names of the two that I already know of. She said the fact that I can't remember my childhood and that I not only lose time for minutes but also for days that it isn't normal and we need to figure out how to help me. I've been in the mental health system since 2001 and have had just about every diagnosis slapped on me. I hope I can finally get some help. I'm honestly about to give up. She also said that she's going to see if they can take me off the Seroquel since it's making me sick and NOT WORKING. So  she asked me what else I've been on and I told her (Haldol - didn't work  Risperdal - didn't work  Zyprexa - didn't work  Paxil/Paxil CR - worked for a little bit then wore off  Wellbutrin - didn't work). She said that she wants to try Depakote  Abilify  or another mood stabilizer. I also took those two journal entries in that I posted last week so she could read them. And  I wish I could get it scanned but it didn't look right to me so I can't show them to you (that's why I just typed it) and she said that one of the interesting things that stood out about the entries is that the handwriting was different in three places. I'm a mess. But believe it or not  after today's session I am a little hopeful. In other news  Carol and I have started working on our book of poetry. We've been throwing around ideas all day and working out some details. We're in the process of getting the poems we want to be in the book together and coming up with a title (which we have already done). We're also working on the different categories that we want the poems to fall under. I've been working around with PagePlus for a couple of hours now trying to figure out how we can set this up. She also has a list of publishers that we're going to be going through as well. I'm also still working on getting around to doing some updates on my webpage and trying to budget out how I can pay for my site so I can get more space and get rid of those damn banner ads. I'm moving as fast as I can but right now I'm having some sinus issues (again).",1
" I take it that by you saying ""Learn to give rather than take and you will find life turns around!"" that you're implying that I'm a taker and not a giver. And maybe that's so. Maybe all the blood that I've donated (it gives me a sense of purpose and sometimes it seems that the nurses there are the only ones who care that I'm alive  and that's only because of what my body produces) or the times when I do things out of the kindness of my heart rather than for monetary gains or as a means to earn someone's favor or to make them somehow indebted to me like others would do  maybe doing all that still means that I'm a taker. I don't know. I've been told that my perceptions can't really be trusted  but that doesn't sound like someone who's a taker to me. I'm 27. And by that age most guys have been in at least one relationship. I haven't. That's why I've set the timeframe. Everyone I know has had at least a taste of love and human companionship by the time they were 30. So I've decided that if no one wants me  why stay? Living alone means seeing what I want on TV....and having absolutely no one to enjoy or discuss it with. That's my view of it. Pessimistic? Yes  but it's been the truth for me. I'm sorry to sound bitter  but this is exactly what I face out in the world. People see my problems and think that it's my fault. I hoped I'd get a different attitude here.",1
" Okay  here's the deal. I'm 17  and I have been depressed and suicidal for as long as i can remember. (See the post ""God Hates Me"") I just want to die. I hate living. It feels like no one cares. In order to combat my depression I write. To date I have written four major writings (50 000- 200  pages -  words or more) and am on my fifth. Last year  when I was on my first major writing one of my friends asked me if she could read it. I was hesitant because it's my soul. I take everything I feel and put it down on the page. It's all I do. i don't go out or have any kind of social life. Writing is my life.  But  I eventually let her read it. She liked it and read that whole writing. Since then she has become my editor of sorts. There's just one problem - she's not editing.  You see  she's a drama geek - in plays and everything - and doesn't have a whole lot of free time so I understand a slow pace  but lately I've had to prod her to do anything. Even over Christmas break she didn't do anything. Now  I have to call her on the weekends (which is the only time she'll even do it now) to get her to do anything. If I don't she'll forget she even has it. Every time I ask her about it  she just tells me how busy she is and I end up feeling guilty. I feel like she's rejecting me as a person  like she's saying ""i just don't care about you."" It hurts me so bad. It makes me feel like the one thing keeping me alive is stupid. It makes me want to kill myself. I feel like it's a burden to her. It hurts me so bad. It makes me go home and cut myself. I have no idea how to handle the situation. I want her to do it  but I don't want it to seem like i'm pestering her. I understand she's busy  but she makes time to go out with her other friends. Couldn't she make a little time for me?  Am I being unreasonable here? What should I do? Please help. ",1
 I'm 20 years old ..... things have been getting harder and harder lately ... i stopped cutting for 9 months .... but i fell apart and got back into it a few days ago .... i cut really bad tonight  and i feel like such a failure .... all i can do is sit here and cry .... the loneliness is really starting to get me ... i just need someone to talk to that understands ... i am seeing doctors and taking medications but they do nothing for me .... the momentary bliss from cutting is all i have since I'm a loner and can't get over my ex ..... if anyone out there understands or doesn't mind listening  please please let me know ....,1
 Hello  I'm Yevgenny  21 years old  and have suffered from depression for...well...I guess as long as I can remember. I started having suicidal thoughts when I was 9  but strangely enough  I can't remember having at that age any concept of suicide. I've been placed on practically all of the antidepressants over the years (with the exception of MAOIs)  and am currently taking Cymbalta--no real side effects  seems effective enough. My father died when I was 18  but that in itself wasn't so sad. Last September  I had a sudden thought regarding my feelings about his death  and I found the most heartbreaking aspect was  like I said  not the fact that he died  but that the process of dying was for him degrading and humiliating. Like me  he was very independent--if he needed help with something  he considered himself defeated; he was content in his own world  like I am  but the magnitude of something like death forced people into his world...those intangible connections between ourselves and others  between him and others  seemed to chain him down. When I had my last breakdown in September  I couldn't stop myself from imagining it; to find yourself suddenly and wholly dependent on others  and for them to force themselves into your mind  your world  and find for themselves some memory or happy relic to take with them such that even your most private  perhaps sacred thoughts and memories are wrenched from you. I thought about what it must've been like to know with certainty that death was all that was left  the helplessness of not being able to face your own future without someone either doing it for you or having earlier robbed you of the existential will power to do it. I attempted to hang myself after my morning classes. I'm not sure how  but before kicking the chair away  I forced myself to call someone because the world is so huge  and I've only had the chance to see such a small part of it  to die then  would've been so meaningless and empty--the very things I was attempting to escape  meaninglessness and emptiness. The friend I called left work immediately and came to me. She cried in one afternoon more than I ever have  and she wasn't even the depressed one. So  fast forward to today. Did some inpatient care. I'm seeing a therapist whom I trust  respect  and have thus far been unable to outwit (it's a good thing.) On a physiological basis  the medication is helping. Psychologically however  I've got some work to do. Ignoring biological/chemical factors  in order for me to be happy  I need to find/build/understand the meaning of my life. I do not believe that man is born with an inherent raison d'etre  or that one is given to him by some divine entity; rather  I believe that the meaning of one's life is self-constructed and in continual flux  it is something you work on  something you subsist upon  and yet is something that is always just out of reach  or one brush stroke undone. Not an easy job. But last week I was on my front porch at around 4pm having a cigarette (I'm keeping this habit for now.) Everything was still  the air still cold with winter but with traces of spring on every tree  the clouds were lit from below and the west  it was like a painting; but it was this oddly static scene that gave me the most lucid understanding of myself  that unstoppable  dynamic thing we call self. And so  more than ever before  I'm going to take treatment seriously and honestly; even if there is sadness  those chance moments of serenity that make up for in intensity what they lack in length  in those instances I think I will find meaning  no  I already have  I suppose. I apologize for how lengthy this became  but I'm guessing it was somehow necessary for me to say. I'm looking forward to talking with the other members of the forum  as I don't think I've ever talked to others who were depressed. Even if I don't find much help here  there might be someone who finds such help in me. Thanks! And  again  I'll try to keep future posts shorter  but in my defense  sometimes when I write I don't feel in control...oh  starting to go off again. Ok  I'm going to stop now.,1

 Hi all  I am in hell of major depression. After being for over 8 years on Elavil and Valium(small dosage)  with good results for most of the time  I tapered down because of the side effects and have been drug free for 1 year. During this year the depression slowly settled in making my life unbearable lately. I don't know what to do. I saw 2 psychiatrists within last month. One of them wanted me on Paxil and the second one on Effexor. Problem is I am so afraid of side effects that I can't begin taking any of them  meantime my life is falling to pieces. My nervous system was completely messed up by these medicines. I had severe fasciculation of muscles for over 4 months after being medicine free (sign of tardive dyskinesia  untreatable neurological condition) and get them back whenever I try any supplement that would increase serotonin level (SAMe  St. John's Wort  Rhodiola). My memory got better after I stopped the medication but now it's falling apart because of the depression I get de-realized I mean if depression won't kill me these medicines will. What are my alternatives (if any)? Shall I take these medicines  for the time being  endure side effects and expose myself to degenerative damage? Shall I stay away from medicines and get incapacitated by depression? Is there any alternative treatment for major depression? I would appreciate any advice. Dania,1

  My first blog...   Here at my workplace.. Got lots to do  but don't know where to start...  My mind's gone blank... Need some coffee... ,0
  Ok  so this is my new blog. Hmmm. I think this looks better over here don't you? Yes  that's nicer. Ok then.   I'd like you to go and visit my website which resides at:  urlLink Bunni's Place    It's not quite finished  because my significant other hasn't finished providing me with his significant content for his part of the site. But the rest is done  or at least done enough that it might be considered enjoyable rather than annoying. Then again some people are annoyed by almost everything enjoyable. One can't make everyone happy.   I decided that a Blog might be a nice addition as I need a place to whine without having to upload a new whiners page to my site. Not that I will always whine here  but since I have the opportunity  I suppose I could. I could also leave the page absolutely blank  and make people wonder what I was up to. Well maybe just my paranoid visitors. Most people probably wouldn't care.   There's that word probably. Chances are  you will not see that word typed on a page of mine often. Since my earliest bbs days I have cut that word down to prolly  and it's become part of my speech. I avoid saying LOL during a conversation however. I actually do laugh out loud.   Well enough of this banter  because there's prolly gonna be more to follow.   I'd love to know how you like the website  and I'd be pleased to share comments and criticism right here in an open forum if you'd like.   Thanks for reading!   bunni ,0
  Oh my!   I haven't been back to post at all!  Have you been visiting my website?  It's prolly going to be moving soon as Atlantic Broadband has bought out Charter Communications.  Charter was my previous ISP.  I'm reworking the site  and making it pretty before it's time to upload it to Atlantic.  I've been busy knitting  crocheting  supporting my Fiance in all his endeavors  looking out for myself  keeping my children well-behaved and productive members of society  and feeding the cat now and then.  I'll try to be better at posting!  Hugs   Carol ,0
  I've been messing around with PSP8 again.  I'm creating some new things  and I'll post links soon enough.  My kids are gone for the week  and I hardly know what to do with myself. It's very rare that I'm left alone to my own devices.  That's about it for today. ,0
"  Which I already knew  of course  but I am feeling pretty sorry for myself. Three and a half weeks ago I tore ligaments in my left knee  effectively curtailing most fun for the next several months. PMO!!! Anyway - the good news is that the bruising has now faded  the swelling is down  I can walk further than I could even a couple days ago. The bad news is that I am still wearing this silly brace and using a cane. The physiotherapist said I ""did a real number"" on my LCL and illotibial band (sp?) and can expect the healing process to take a while. It could have been worse right? I could have broken my leg or completely torn the LCL. It could have been my right leg and I wouldn't be able to drive.   So much for paddling this summer. At this point I still can't bend my knee far enough to get or out of a boat. I CAN still do weights though and I had a short somewhat successful trial on my indoor bike a couple days ago. I walked around the bloack today too - not exactly the 10km run I wished I was doing  but a few days ago I could only make it halfway around and today the whole loop was easy. Progress  progress.  My plan for tomorrow is to get up and ride my bike (indoors again) after I do my physio exercises. ",0
  Well  all in all things are going well. Day two went well yesterday and I tried to report it to my journal on www.BFL101.com but it is down. Since Monday a.m. I've dropped 4 1/2 lbs of water weight (who's kidding who here - I KNOW it is water) but weight is weight and it feels good. I've eaten clean for two whole days (except for a nip of Brandy last night) and it feels terrific.  Yesterday I rode my bike indoors on the windtrainer for a whole 20 minutes! I can't wear my regular brace when I do that because it only gives my 90deg of movement  and I need about 115 to ride. So I wore the tensor  which seemed to be enough. And I iced it down after.  Today is a weights day. I will get going after I drop the kids off.  Kyle had a friend over yesterday and they spent hours on the computer going to funny links. A couple are great star trek TNG clips. I'll have to try to find them.  LCS ,0
  Ok  so  i used to have a weblog at xanga.com  with all my friends as well. and it just got to the point that...i  couldn't  anymore. i was so tired of not being able to be open (my friends and i are close-knit  but i have a thingee i keep from them and it's just getting bigger  yeah  more on that later) and it hurt me  'cause i knew how easy it would be to just say  'hey!' but i can't! oh man  i'm silly  and secretive  and bashful.  anyway  the huge secret? not that big: i don't have cancer  know the formsula for cold fusion  have a secret life as a prostitute  my parents aren't getting divorced...it's not anything that big. *heaves a huge sigh* ok  this is tough to say in the open. i have a crush on one of my friends  who read my site  kyle. a HUGE crush  a crush that makes it hard to breathe  and lives up to the name *crush*!  ok  enough for today? you're probably bored. :) later  i'm out. ,0
  today is at least a year  if not two  since my last post. in that meantime  i've had three other xanga sites  multiple mini crushes  one devastating one  and more other random things that i can possibly say. i am apart from my friends once again. perhaps by choice this time  i learned this year that between those i hold dearest and myself is a completely different value system. i can't expect to change people  to make friends conforms to what i hold important. i have to change. one year. one year more. one year more and no more. no more. no more. ,0
  a friday all alone! this weekend means i have the house to myself. may i just share  however  that this weekend is in no way mine. the act's own my fucking ass saturday morning and my job has 'property of misty's' stmaped on it friday and saturday night. after work saturday  people are coming over to drink  cause that's the cool thing to do in high school  don't you know. sigh.  *pinches bridge of nose in exasperation* i have such a hard life. ;-) ,0
"  Still haven't gotten very far in the planning and execution of the ""Get my Life in Order"" desire.  I just can't seem to take that next step that will get me where I want to be.  I still weigh the same.  My finances are just as bad.  And getting worse.  I feel drawn to write and to voice over work  but can't bring myself to act on that conviction.  I know what I need to do to make my life work  but am stuck at the same old place.  I want to be the person God created me to be more than anything else.  What do I have to lose right?  I don't like where I am  but it's familar  but I'll never realize my potential if I don't.  HELP!!!!!!!!!! ",0
  Back once again.   I'm going to change my eating  work  spending and cleaning habits.    Really.  I am.  I've been working at making God the center of my life more the past week and it seems to have helped.  I don't want to be this way anymore.  But I don't want to lose what I like.    I shut down and I don't like that.  I don't want to avoid or delay  but there are some things I don't have a solution for  so I don't know how to face them.    Anyway.   Took my measurements and weighed in today.  Height:   245 pounds Chest:     57.5 inches Waist:     49 inches Hips:       57 inches  I want to take care of myself.  I need to take care of myself.  I just don't think I know how. ,0
  Everything seems to be getting worse.  Not only did I get a call last night from the lady who handles one of my credit card accounts  I got a call this morning from my mortgage company.  I don't have the money for this month's payment and the payment I arranged last month to cover the July payment didn't clear.   I have a number for a lawyer to help with getting everything put in my name.  I need to talk to my boss.  They've let me know that they might - maybe- willing to help me out with everything.  Why do I let this happen?  I know what's coming  so why do I let it happen?  I hate this.  I'm intelligent  mature  responsible.  Why do I do this? ,0
  Below you'll find a pic of the place we now call home.  Its in Takoma Park - what I consider to be the finest subset of DC.  We're in a real neighborhood  with friendly neighbors and treelined streets  but we're still a 4 min walk from the metro  and a 20 min ride from downtown.  It comes at a price  though  and there are a few things wrong with the house.  In fact  I'm about to go check to ensure the basement didn't flood last night!  That said  I couldn't be happier with it.  Don't you love our faux stone? ,0
  Welcome to my blog.  My ambition is to record my thoughts and ideas as I find a job  explore dc  and hopefully come across a partner in crime.  It'll be more or less unedited... just pure musings.  enjoy. ,0
  am i in love with you know who?  i think that i may be  though i have never thought about or really fantasized about being with him. ,0
  This week was somewhat of a breakthrough in the jobsearch.  I even got an offer for a job I had to refuse.  On Tuesday I got two phonecalls.  One was from Turning the Page  an organization that does professional development for teachers and connects communities to schools.  They were calling for a second interview.  The other was from Hispanic CREO  a group that advocates for school choice reforms.  They offered me a (well) paid internship until something else comes up.   I had my TTP interview yesterday  and I think it went really well.  I don't want to count my eggs before they hatch  though.  I have no idea what my competition looks like! ,0
  My internship will start tomorrow.  It sounds like a really intense place  so i'm nervous about the whole thing.  i've always fit in in office enviros really well  and i've tended to do well in those places.  i think i'll be sucessful.  i also don't think its going to be very hard at all.  i'll post tomorrow to let everyone know how it went. ,0
  Hi  this blog is an attempt to keep track of my more vivid dreams in order to figure out what the hell is going on in them. ,0
  My cat  Dolemite  who passed away about a month ago was actually just away and came back. I still had Gunther and they seemed to get along ok. The odd thing was that I had given Dolemite some hot sauce in a playful manner and he had thrown it up on my rug. I don't know what the hot sauce means  but I do know that seeing Dolemite means I still miss him. ,0
  The first dream was that my little brother brought over season three of The Shield on DVD  but it was a poor quality rip from a VCR recording.  The second dream is that I was out on the beach with my brother and he went into the water and pulled out a morray eel and attempted to behead it. He only got down to the last string before he stopped and it was still alive and cleaning it's self like a cat. I was pretty disturbed by this so I begged him to finish the job and just put it out of it's misery. I know this one is in connection to the recent beheadings in the middle east. ,0
  I was taking a tour of the white house with my mother and grandmother and my aunt and uncle from that side happened to be there as well as Laura Bush. ,0
  Last night  I drempt that a co-worker  Lea  came to my desk to ask what I was listening to for another co-worker. I have no idea what this dream means at all. ,0
  Work was situated between two buildings  a Walgreens and a Safeway supermarket. I was there with a long ex-employee and a new employee (who was kinda a nerd and annoying) and my boss came out of this room  that I had never seen before and was some sort of control room. I have no idea what this means. ,0
  Dream 1 - I found another black cat who was just like my old cat Dolemite in most ways  the size  the personality and everything and I wasn't sure if it was him or not  but I was going to keep him. He and Gunther seemed to get along. But all of this occured in my grandparent's old house in MA. I still really miss Dolemite. ,0
"  after the work i'm doing everyday..i still find the chance to sitback and relax to a hot and not that comfortable room..but slow music in the background. in that hot and not comfortable room  i realize lots of things. like being alone in a valentine's day in my 4-teenage years.  yup  i always say ""i hate valentines day  it's just for the couples who love each other."" ok  it 's a big lie the night i realized it..we should celebrate the valentines day that we really love and care for like our families and true friends. the next time that valentines day will come  i'll invite my whole barkada to have fun.  every entry i publish here would be my feelings and realizations in my hot and not that comfortable room.. :) i hope it can help you to realize things too.. ",0
  i'll be writing what i really feel here in this blog..even iff it's mushy or very corny..you don't care 'coz it's my feeling.. ,0
  everytime i have a crush  i'm always hoping for something that might not come true. i always end up daydreaming about him  i can't concentrate on the things i'm doing. sometimes  i convience myself that the guy i like might like somebody else  but i still like him.  maybe the word  martyr  is next to my name. i'm always waiting for the right guy but i always falling with the wrong guy. a friend e-mailed me about what those the selection their mean  the question # 8 asked to choose a # between 1-10..i choose 8..and it says thare that's the number i will fall in love before i get married..that's so weird. ok  i admit it..i easily fall in love with a guy that is really sweet nice  good-looking and accepts me for who i am.. gtg..i've got some work to do.. ,0
  one of my friends told me that their is a big change to her attitude. i think she changed after what happened tonight. and not only her but all of them. and i'll be honest  i've changed..a lot! honestly  i'm afraid to tell them what i really feel about our friendship. i'm always hidding what i feel  one of my friend told me that  i might comit suicide  if i don't tell anyone the problems i'm keeping to myself. i'll not comit suicide  and i don't want to hurt myself.  anyways  i'll change for the better. ,0
"  So this is a good idea. There is so much going on in my life...yes  a way to keep track of it is good. Maybe I'll get motivated...we'll see .            So let's start with ""The Diet""...     I started about 6 weeks ago. (I think  I can't remember really.) The start weight was 255  and I made a goal of losing 100 pounds. Ok  so we'll count this as week Six......down to 233. Total lost: 22 pounds. ",0
  So...I didn't lose any weight last week. This is not surprising  being that I had the most bizarre cravings  and thus binged a few times. I didn't gain weight  so I'm not going to complain too much...So still...we're at 233. I dunno what the hell is wrong with me  but I'm actually going to call a doctor. I've got to be hella sick or feel really damn bad to even consider such a thing. But I hurt  I've been up all night  and the shit has got to stop. Drugs...that's what I need.  Bucky. Hehe  what can I say besides that? I absolutely cannot believe the whirlwind of feeling and emotion that has come to me as a result of him. Last weekend was so  so wonderful. I miss him so much. I never  ever intended to fall in love or to let emotion get involved. I mean  how taboo is it to see a married man? However  when the said couple is poly....I mean  why not? He says he can love me and love Megan too  and that he isn't going anywhere. So I'm just going to have fun  enjoy the ride for as long as it lasts  and hopefully  learn from the experiences. Regardless  I love him. It's been a long time since I felt love for a man. It's hard to admit to myself  but I do want him  and to a certain extent  maybe I even think that I need him. There is some connection there that I can't put my finger on. I've no idea what it is...maybe a past life or something.  Anyway  onto the doctor callings I go. ,0
  Ive had this blog for a while and have been working on a new template  self-teaching myself cascading style sheets. Ive decided to keep this pre-designed template provided by blogger.com. I suppose its alright...quite professional looking. I applaud whoever makes these. But my new one will be the shit.   Anyway  I was having a good day today until 3rd period and I had english. We're supposed to be a democracy right? That is the whole point of our country  the American Dream. Well  why is school have such a FASCIST system? They tell us what we have to learn and force us to learn in no matter what. If we dont we are threatened with referrals for insubordination or possibly even suspended. What the fuck is this. I hate public school  alot of teachers just dont care about their students. I know if you're a public school kid you just cant possible fathom how much better a private school like Gilman is and I'm sorry if I offend you. I think Ill stop now...please feel free to leave comments. I'll read them. ,0
"  Ive been talking to this girl Jessica for a while now  perhaps about 3 months. It has come to the point where we both want to officially start ""seeing"" each other but we lack the dating experience. What I mean by this is that we have only really gone out together twice. So she has decided that she would like to wait. But she didnt tell me this until the day after that she told me that she wanted to finally make it official. This chick seems so high maintenance that it drives me crazy. Lets say that I dont respond to her on the internet for 1 minute or more she thinks I dont want to talk to her or something else is wrong. ",0
"  ""...or from him touching me..heh.. :D"" A quote from the girl that I am supposedly talking to and about to go out with's away message. To be honest it has been about 2 weeks since we've seen eachother but a few days before she told me that she wanted to be with me but then she writes shit like this? Is it wrong for me to have an awkward type feeling? I dont think so. Why are you women so god damn complicated? Can't you just tell us the truth instead of making guys like me assume what you're thinking.   Doesnt seem like anyone reads this but I guess it's good for me to relieve tension. ",0
  I suppose I should have a little more content to justify the massive  page-lengthening links list at right. (Okay  it's not that massive  but it's longer than the lone post.)  I haven't been thinking about much lately  just doing whatever to get through the day. I haven't been sleeping too well either  for some reason. I sleep through the night but I wake up just as exhausted as the night before. This weekend was nice; I slept quite a bit and lazed around at home. Stress-free. Mom and Grandma are visiting Grandpa in Grand Rapids  so I'm just hanging out online for a few more hours. I should make a shopping list and maybe take Grandpa's van to go shopping. I'd rather wait and go with Matt  but he has to mow the lawn and take care of the trash after he's done with his class. And Grandpa just called and said he's got a prescription to be picked up at the pharmacy before 6pm  so I might as well go by myself.  Thinking about this coming school year  too. I'm so anxious to be done  I just want to get Matt's grad school stuff taken care of and move on with our life. I have one theory class to complete a Communications minor  but it's now cancelled for the Fall semester  which means it will be offered during the Winter semester. If I take it then  it will be alongside the theory class I need for my Literature major  and that would make my brain implode (again). So maybe that was just decided for me. As things stand  this fall I'm taking World Novels (Lit)  Western Civilization to 1500 (History)  Beginning Latin  French 301  and a morning volleyball class for an even 12 credits. I probably could have handled the theory class this fall  or dropped either Western Civ or Latin and volleyball  but we'll see if it's still cancelled by mid-August. I also need to apply for graduation  but my advisor is out of town this summer  so we'll wait until the Fall semester has started.  It's freezing cold in this house. I wish I'd brought a jacket or a sweatshirt. I suppose I could drive home and get either  but meh. I'll survive. ,0
  So...I'm on Blogger.  Not sure if I'll move from  urlLink my Livejournal   but I was interested in checking out Blogger and how it works. Also  if I ever have a website separate from a blogging site  I'll probably get some use out of this.   In the meantime  though  enjoy its emptiness. Yarr. ,0
"  Hello       I am trying this blog thing for the first time  I kinda like the idea of it... today has started off pretty good  I still have to vacum the house... yesterday was a great day... unfortunatly the voices in my head keep on telling me to do things  things they have never told me to do before... they used to always tell me to kill and to hurt... but now they are trying to help me I think  you see  yesterday I went to the mall with my girlfriend  and we went and saw a movie together. My voices only come out in the dark and it happened to be just dark enough in the theater for me to hear them. Throught the whole movie they were telling me to do stuff like  put my arm around her  kiss her  stuff like that... sometimes it got plain disturbing the things they told me (I won't repeat them...) but overall yesterday was an awesome day... last night though  when I got home  they ""punished"" me for the times that I wouldn't listen to them... they were screaming inside my head that I am worthless  that I have no chance of having a real life if I refuse to listen to them... and last night I had a dream about what it would have been like had I listened to them... I don't know what to do... I think that they are trying to trick me to trusting them so that they can eventually have me do things that I will really regret... but I don't know... also... my girlfriend's ex  Richie (grr... must... kill..)  keeps on telling her that she has to break up with me and start talking to him again in order for her to have a chance of getting back into thespians  god  I truly do hate him... he is using things that I can't stand that I said against me now... and it really get's to my girlfriend... god  I love her so frigin much... but I just don't know what to do sometimes... I think  hell  I know she still has feelings for him... but I couldn't confront her about them in a million years... my best friend  kevin  thinks that I should break up with her... but god  i just couldn't bear to do such a thing... well  I'd better go... I've got more to write  I may post again later tonight... ",0
  Alexander's bed time story selection was  Richard Scarry's Cars and Trucks and Things That Go . This is one of his favorite books. The illustrations are excellent  and the story is a fun one that doesn't drive me crazy after reading it for the hundredth time. ,0
"  Today was Teddy Bear day at Alexander's daycare. All of the kids in his class were supposed to bring Teddy Bears  yesterday they made Teddy Bear books out of construction paper - you get the picture. Alexander does not like to get boxed in to conventional thinking so he interpreted it as ""pet"" day. This opened up his entire stuffed animal collection to be taken to school. Alexander chose his Big Bird to take to school  but it is no ordinary  stuffed  Big Bird. Oh no. This one was given to him as paybacks for some annoying toy that my wife or I gave to someone else's child. This Big Bird has a whole bunch of games that you can choose by squeezing his toes. He also has a backpack full of blocks that have letters  numbers  and shapes. You put a block into his hand and talks about it  depending on which game you picked. Sounds good on paper  right? The catch is that some deviant toy maker endowed this Big Bird with the most annoying  nasal voice - and it has no off switch. That's right. Once you awaken the bird  it starts talking  trying to get the child to play  it waits a few seconds  and then tries again  and again  and again.... Remember how I said that there is no off switch? Yeah. I imagine that the designers of this toy are in a witness protection program somewhere. Think about how this toy got made - in some corporate meeting room  an assortment of marketing  technical  sales  and other people got together - probably many times  reviewed this design  and decided that it was a good idea. Anyway  this is what Alexander took to school. I thought that I had hidden it better than that  but I was mistaken. Anyway  when I took him into his room  his teacher thought that The Bird was cute - and then he awakened it. I chose that moment to beat feet out of there. In the evening when I returned to pick up Alexander  his bird was not in his cubby with his blanket and other things. It was on top of the cabinets as far out of reach as the teachers could make it. They must not like that voice  either. ",0

  It started off as a fine day. Got up early  came to work. As usual  my PC would give me some slight problems  but after a while  it would be okay.  New colleague really giving me lots of headache. Taught him thousand and one things and all he can remember is only 0.01% of everything. This is a real saddening case. Wish that I can just fire him and save my hair from turning all white.  Half hour to lunch. Wonder what's there to eat? Let's hope no more LG1 food. Getting sick and tired of the food there. Making me shirt and etc stink like crazy.  Toothache seriously aching like crazy now. Must see doc. Most probably  whole tooth will have to come out. Damn.  Phones also giving problem. LCD problem. aiii. Why do these LCDs always give humongous problems? Really cannot stand it already. Everytime an LCD fails  it stays in the workshop for dunno how long.  KTMB also another one. Giving problems like nobody's business. Wanna give them busines  they dun wan. Real tired of them already. Called them dunno how long  they dun answer. :( Hope they reply my sms.  After work  had a great time. Jessy called. We just talked about everything and anything. She was at the pasar malam. Then I told her that I'll call her right after she gets back. I did.   We talked and talked and talked for 2 hours and 30 minutes. We are just normal friends. We talked bout unique names for her kids (Zanique  Danielle  Cyclice / Celynn) and she commented a few for me (I Lai  He Lai  She Lai  They Lai  We Lai  It Lai). Both of us were just plain talking. It's hard to find someone that you can click to in just a short while. Plus  we did more than just click. We were close  quite close friends already.  Her boyfriend's coming back tomorrow. She must be really happy. Can tell from the tone on her voice.   Well  that's all for today. See ya. ,0
  It seems to be a very long day today. Feeling sleepy and stuff. :(   Knight Online's gonna start charging really soon. Don't know whether to pay or not to pay. Why do these online games have to charge? Can't they remain free throughout ur entire life? I would seriously love free P2P games.  Samsung phones are really getting the best of me. I seem to be bored of Samsung phones already. I do not know why. They are basically something like Nokia also. Same phone functions  different name only. ,0
  By the way  anyone can feel free to IM me later tonight. I'll be online at 8:30. Well  ttyl. Love Always  Chloe ,0
  Hey  my name is Chloe and I am 13 years old. I am 5 foot 6 inches  I have dirty blonde hair  blue eyes  and I weigh ___ pounds. I am in the 6th grade for 16 1/2 more days and then I'm going to a private school. The new school is my choice and I can't wait to go. Not only will I make a new beginning  but I will get away from all the people that I have a bed reputation with. This summer  I'm babystiing and making 550 dollars. Shopping!!! Anyways  my few true friends that I have now are Sarah  Rachel  Andrea  Tess  Kali  and that is about it. I am currently single because I just broke up with my old boyfriend. I broke up w/ him because he was not talking about appropriate things and it wasn't working out. Right now I am in a fight with two people; Madison and Missy. Missy is always going to hate me and Madison....well  I can't trust her at all. Anyways  it's 3:13 right now and I just got home from a long day at school. I am really bored. Uggh. Well  I guess I'll see you later. Love Always  Chloe ,0
  I just got a packet for the new private school I'm going to and the dress code is REALLY strict. I mean  the girls can't wear pink! We can't have heavy make-up on or short skirts. I am actually reconsidering my choice. I guess I'll have to think some more. If you peeps have any comments about it or some advice  please let me know. Love Always  Chloe ,0
  In a few weeks I'm going to Minnesota. I love going there bc everybody loves me. They are family after all. So  this time I'm staying there for another week after the family leaves bc I have all that money. I'll edit this later. I'm too lazy. Love  Chloe ,0
  So we have 6 1/2 days left of school. I can't wait for it to be over. Yeah  so I just got home from school and it was soooo boring. I'm waiting for my friends to get online. Well  someone juss got online so I'll ttyl. Love Chloe ,0
  Hello Bloggers and Bloggetts. Being this is my first post  a little background is in order. I am a 37 yr. old male with a penchant for technology  or as my wife likes to call me - I am a techno-geek. I am currently working for a LARGE technology company. I specialize in WINS and active directory  which are the Microsoft services for respectively finding and managing objects in a domain. Yes - I am plugging what I do in hopes of finding something interesting later on. Right now we are merging two networks and it has proven to be a challenge.  Also  I have been working on the website for my wife's business: http://www.oneclickawayphoto.com/.  TTFN. I'll post more later. ,0
"  Today I got my Orange belt in Choi Kwang Do. The last ""light"" colored belt before Green which goes into the darker colored belts. I took the pictures tonight of the belt ceremony using my wife's Fuji S2. Sharp camera! Since I am an asst instructor I am now teting every month. I have my patterns down through Green belt  and plan on learning Blue and Purple patterns this week. :)  This weekend I did my first ""non-official"" videography event - a ""reception"" party for a couple that was married in Hawaii several months ago. Luckily it did not rain since it was an outside event. :) I took about 2 hours of film. I would think that a wedding would have actually been easier since there are actual ""events"" that you have to capture. This was basically just a party and therefore I became more the voyeur than the observer like normal weddings in that I had to walk around taping interesting converstaions. Luckily the bride & groom both have very outgoing personalities as do most of their close friends. My wife was the photographer (http://oneclickawayphoto.com) so in some cases I followed her around. But as the night wore on and the drinks became more potent I was able to pull out some interesting stories from some of the key attendees. Though I was really wanting Grandma to participate but she did not like the idea of being taped. Must be a generational thing. :)  Have you ever had a mental image of someone you worked with over long distances  but then when you actually met them or saw their picture realized your image was WAY off base? Had that happen today. Man - talk about being wrong. :)   Anyway - I'm off to play XBox. Later! ",0
  I have never tried this before  but I thought it was a time for a forum to display my thoughts and ideas as I struggle through this world.  I hope people will read it sometime. ,0
  I just got back from seeing the movie I  Robot starring Will Smith.  Let's just say I was just a tidge disappointed in the movie.  First of all  when I heard that this movie was coming out I picked up the book (not the misleading one with Will Smith on the cover).  I was fascinated by the book in the fact that it was a series of vignettes about the evolution of robots from mindless machines to a species equal to ours  all shown through the eyes of a robot pschoanalyst.  I thought these stories were amazing and saw a definite flow to all the unlinked stories.  This made me very intriqued about how the movie was going to be.     I had read that Alex Proyas was going to take liberties with the plot  but keep Isaac Asimov's vision intact.  I believe he failed  miserably.  What Mr Proyas made was just another unbelievable action movie that appeal to the dense overly stimulated action freak with none of the intended vision to what he speaks of.  It is sad really there was so much emotion and cerebral moments that were lots in the mindless CGI and laws of physics bending fight sequences that have been over used by ever movie since the first Matrix.  In fact they should have called this a Matrix prequal that George Lucas would have been proud of (including the apparently useless sidekick kid from Even Stevens that didn't have to do with anything in the story except a cheap laugh  can you say JAR-JAR).       There was some redeeming value  there was some witty dialogue that kept the plot interesting.  But of course  like all Will Smith movies  there was far too many pointless one-liners.   Another point was the fact that the leading lady wasn't just some no brain supermodel which was hard to believe that she actually could read the script (Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough)  but they found some one less than perfect who was actually believable though still too young to be a brilliant scientist.       Overall the movie was entertaining  but not something that Asimov would have been proud to go see. ,0
  Gahhhhh Need to get the hell outta here.....fucking place...meh oh well. Chillin at Duds after school...hopefully Sarah'll b there n hopefully Eric can make it to pick me up today....we'll see...in anycase should prolly get back to my fuckin ICA's b4 Senft finds me...sneaky lil bastard lol ,0
  Gah sittin at school Eric n I jes set this shit up jes checkin if it works... ,0
  School sux  I saw Dennis today and he somehow had the nerve to tell me I still owe him money. Now what the fuck kind of shit is that?! I dunno that jes pisses me off he has no right to ask for any kind of compensation after that. He took the money out of me in physical pain as well as hospital bills and the pure fact that he could be owing me money a whole lot quicker with one call to the cops. Dennis sit back  realize how cool about this I've been and give me a motherfucking break. Im still paying goddamn court fees from before and I dont have a fucking job so just accept me being cool and what you did payment enough. Whatever s'bullshit. So neways on a different note...I was glad I got to talk to Sarah last night  I feel bad tho because I can't help but feel bad for being the person who came between her and Tina. Todays just a generally bad day and all I can hope for is for it to start going better....sometime.... ,0
  This weekend went by fast  even though it was lacking in things to do. Despite the budsmoke it was a kinda sucky weekend. I dunno...I haven't been going out with Sarah long and I don't know her very well  but I feel like its always gonna stay that way. We never seem to spend more than a half an hour--tops together and theres never any conversation. I wish we could talk or see each other but maybe shes just too busy...Guess I'll just have to wait for that one day when I call shes home or she calls me to see her...that one day...somewhere down the road. I came home early tonight to do some make-up work and Im glad to say I at least got some done so hopefully I can pass grammer  I don't know about ICA though those essays seem to be amongst the missing. Well going back to my bed and the one thing I can always count on to be comforting...sleep. ,0
  Hey  Well this is my blog  basically I'll just be bitching about what is going on with me and posting non-sence when I'm bored. Occasionally I'll post pics and whatnot for opinions and comments but other than that  there will be nothing of substance here. I'm useing this for two reasons  I'm too lazy to learn how to code to make my website interesting and nice looking  and I like to bitch about stuff and this is a very easy was to get that done. So ya  if you don't know me and you read any further blogs it'll probably be funny  if you know me  well then I guess the level of humor will depend on whether or no I'm bitching about YOU. ,0
  I have to write somthing so here it goes:  somthing ,0
"  OMG it is so hot and humid! Today was this || close to being absolutely horrible  but there was one saving grace  and I'll save that for the end of this post. So  today I realized the full extent of the work I have to do (and should be doing now  but its too fucking HOT to stay focused) and have not done. All of my classes where boring as hell  History was the usual blend of note taking and sitting around with nothing to do  but today it was like a sauna (this is not good). I skipped Chem. to go have lunch with Tegan  which was really fun ;-)  this would be the saving grace I mentioned. After finally saying ""bye"" to her *sigh*  I booked it back to Elmira to make it to class only about 5 min late for Physics. Again it was like a sauna in that class  even with the windows open  and we watched a movie and worked on the project I left at home in my rush to meet Tegan on time. So effectively did nothing. English was the same except the whole class didn't do any work  even Mr. Miessner didn't seem like he wanted to do work so he just let us talk all class. That class was productive  gossip wise  because I found out some interesting things about Chadder's ex. which I found quite funny.  Verdict: day as a whole sucked serious ass  but there where a few good times (thanks Tegan) ",0
  urlLink Chris Anckaert  - sorry  it's in Dutch  as I'm a Dutch-speaking Belgian... ,0
"  I went over to my brother's yesterday evening to give him a demo of Knoppix. It was a CD which I got with my Dutch magazine PC-Active. The version is 3.3 His impression before putting the CD in was that Linux was overall much to difficult to learn  after all  he'd been using Windows since he has a PC - which is a fair few years now. When the KDE desktop appeared with working sound his face simply lit up. He didn't have to say anything  I could hear him think ""wow!"". We had a look through the main menu-structure and just ran a few programs - Mozilla  KMail  KStars  the Control Centre. He was simply impressed. I have to say  even from the CD  Knoppix is fast and reliable. He's now going to play around with the CD for a while and will probably get more enthousiastic as time goes by. In a couple of weeks (days?)  I expect a request to make him a permament install on his hard-drive. He had just had a lot of virus-related problems and his windows-box had grind to a halt a couple of days ago. He was very interested in learning that with this operating system  no more of that would happen. He was also worried he wouldn't be able to do the things in Linux he did under Windows  but after showing him OpenOffice.org  this was no longer an issue.  Oh  by the way  there is a new version of Knoppix  3.4 - read all about it on the  urlLink Knoppix website ",0
  I would like to welcome everybody who happens to visit this page. Discussions I'm interested in are about Linux  Open Source  programming  etc...  Feel free to reply or make a posting yourself.  Chris. ,0

"  OK. I've been wanting to blog for awhile. Thing is I can't decide how honest I want to be in it. What if someone in the family found it? Guess I'll just have to take that chance. So anyway  what I really wanted to write about is Shana. I hate talking to anyone in the family about her because I don't want to upset them. I mean  what if they're having a good day? Then I pour out all of my stuff and make them start grieving again. Although I know  realistically  that we'll never stop grieving. I still cannot believe that she killed herself. Immediately after  that week  sometimes someone would say it must have been an accident. But come on  Shana was brilliant. She knew how little she was. Taking a bottle of anti-depressants and pain pills was not an accident. She wanted to leave. She wanted the pain to stop. That's why she took them at bedtime.  I still hear my brother describing how he found her. Right after we got to the house he told us everything. Took us up to Shana's room and showed us her bed. Showed us where he carried her to the top of stairs and tried CPR. Told us the police had to pry her out of his arms. Told us she was already getting stiff. And she was cold  he said  so cold. Sometimes I can't stop hearing the stuff from that week. I can hear him crying my name.  I remember so much from that week. Picking out the fingernail polish  helping Grandma iron her clothes. Previewing her hair and makeup with my sisters. We took a picture for reference. My sister was so tough. I couldn't see the details through the tears but J did.  Even writing in my journal I feel like I need to edit stuff out. But I can't. It's time to get this stuff out. Shana's been gone for over a year and I still don't really believe it. She was only 19 and had so much to live for. I'll never stop wondering why.  Her suicide note was in her live journal. Titled ""Enough is Enough"". That's it. I'm done. I love you all... The same message  or maybe a little longer  was set up as an 'away' message in outlook. I never could bring myself to email her so I'd get it back as a reply. I asked my sister if she'd made up an album of Shana stuff. She said she thought the pictures belonged interspersed with other family pictures. I don't know though. Seems like I might do an album - but do I put the funeral notice and program in there too? I wanted to keep them. Don't know why. ",0
  You lil' ass! I told you not to tell Dest what I had said! Now she hates me more than before  oh well i guess. I can't be angry  no matter how hard i try i can't do it. Well  not at least since me and Abie got together. (Abie  if you are reading this  I love you  Baby!) The only thing I can be is happy . . . Is that a good thing?!? If not it sure feels like it! Garrett  I may not be angry with you  but I'll still kick your ass  you lil' bitch! Now I know i can't tell you anything  without it being repeated! That's depressing  or it would be if I wasn't thinking about Abie . . . ,0
  OMG! Today was like so incredibly great! Abie came home with me from school to go and see Awkward Romance performs. (They are like the greatest Christian band  ever! ROCK ON!) Well all I have to say about this afternoon before church is that Im gonna need to start wearing chapstick like all the time now . . . ::naughty grins:: I dont like chapstick  but I think its worth it . . . Did I mention that I love Abie  yet? No? Well I did now. The concert was great and all  but I think her and me would have had a better time  if we had stayed home instead . . . oh well . . . ,0
  Someone finally told Dest how they really felt other than me  that makes me so incredibly happy! Im not sure who said it  but Lydia had something to add to it. She said to Dest  Youre a sweet girl  you just need to shut your fucking mouth! Garrett  Im sorry that Im saying all this  but this is how I really feel. Dest made me sooo damn mad today; she was talking about how she hates when people talk bad about other people behind their bavks  but she was doing the same damn thing to Michelle. And Michelle is the last damn person I would stand up for  but Dest pissed me off sooo fucking bad! All I hate to say when I walked into the RamPage office was HYPOCRITE and Dod so completely agreed with me. I know Im a hypocrite  but if I ever get as bad as Dest I hope someone tells me or knocks the hell out of me  one or the other! ,0
  The purpose of this blog is to track my progress as my life takes a new direction.  After a few years of drifting I've set a new path; new life goals.  I will also use this blog to reflect on current events and my reaction to them.  I've been reading blogs for a couple of years now so it I've decided to take the plunge.  Hopefully I will not bore anyone to tears. ,0
  Here it is the beginning of the third week of my shortened Summer Semester at City College of San Francisco.  I am taking Physiology as the first of 2 prerequisites I need to apply for a Masters of Nursing program.  If anyone reading this blog does NOT find this interesting I don't blame you.  But for me  out of school for over 10 years its a HUGE shock to my system.  I'll reflect more on this tomorrow and start working in some politics! ,0
  So I didn't get around to posting more earlier as I expected....I'll get better.  I'm now over halfway done with my marathon summer semester.  I never took Physics in high school.  Not sure how I passed Chemistry my junior year.  But  for now  I'm doing well in Physiology.  I'm loving it!  Science is cool.  I spent the last 20+ years fearing references to science and now I want to go out of my way to read or watch them.    Admittedly I have changed over the past year or so.  A life crisis (as opposed to a mid-life crisis which I am not old enough to have yet) let me to decide I want to go into nursing.  To do that I have to plunge into science.  Now I find its not bad.  Where did I get the impression it was?  The larger question in my mind is what happens in our schools that so many children and teens like myself end up hating science?  Can something be done to change that.  Everyone has different interests; be they theater  media  science  athletic or something else.  However  shouldn't our schools foster at least an interest or respect for all areas?  With obesity increasingly an issue athletics are important.  Science technology is equally important.  What would life be without music or theater?  In the rush to standardize test I think we are missing the large point problem.  It is that kids should enjoy school.  We have all had good teachers who make learning fun.  As a society we need to study those teachers and start pushing for more like them. ,0
  Hi   I do not known if i will be able to write about my life all the time. I am not used of speaking a lot. First  let me introduce myself. I am 26 year old  i am french ( yes nobody's prefect) and my friends says that i'm prbably one of the less down-to-earth guy they've ever met !!!   What coul I add. I'm playing guitar  have a idea on everyting (eh pal  i'm French !!!) and i'm gay. Well  i have to leave you today but i'm determined to come back very soon. See you later on the great world of internet. ,0
  I was recently watching one of my favourite movies  the wizard of Oz and i realized that you can only move on if you learn that dreams don't necesseraly come true  that pain don't necesseraly pass by and that you have to lock your dreams and your hopes somewhere deep in your soul. It is hard to find out that you will not be necesseray happy  you will not find someone who loves you the way you love him. But it doesn't matter  you learn to come along  you learn to get tougher and tougher. I'm afraid  afraid of waking me up one day and find out that i'm feeling anything. I prefer to suffer  because it means I'm alive... ,0
  France and the Allies celebrated last week end one of the most fantastic military operations ever made in the world. Never so much depended on so few courageous soldiers wo sacrified to free a continent they didn't know. I'm 26 and i knom i'm living in a free land thanks to brave young men who fought for what they believe to be right. I will always love this America but i can help thinking that today America is on the wrong way. America's grief is justified  America is right to launch attacks against a faceless ennemy who wants to burn the whole world but this fight can be boiled down to a fight between evil and good  to a crusade against barbarians  it will be dangerous and counterproductive. Europe knows how complex is the world  europe knows how high is the price of blood and Europe doesn't want to be part of the wrong war. The United States are our closest friends and friends don't have to agree on everything. On the contrary  i will be happy if my friends tell me that i'm about to make a huge mistakes  that i act like a fool. I will be very thankful and i will accept this lend hand... because i don't want to stumble and fall in the Depths ,0
  Last week it all came to a head after months of holding it in   I quit my job and this is what happened:  You know how little things can build up and you hold it inside  until you can't take it any more? Well thats what I did.   I came back last week at the end of the day and Jim started on  me about something that was of no big deal but I blew up and started  yelling at him and him at me and the next thing I know I quit.  I stormed out of the office and went home. It hit me what I had  just done about half way home.  I knew I was wrong in geting mad and quiting but what was done was done. I went home and told my wife and she didn't say a word. ,0
"  I work for Lilac Window Cleaning and this is my story.  I started working here back in 1988 and left after a year and came back 6 years later after I let go by Main window cleaning after a medical problem.  It was a good time to move on so it was no big deal.  Me and the owner seem to hit heads a lot but it also happens with the other guys too.  Jim (owner) is not the easiest person to get along with.  At the beginning of the day Jim gives us a route sheet with all the informsation about the Equipment  we need for the day and a list and addresses of the jobs and who we are working with and the truck  we will take.  Most of the time he has to remember who won't work together that week because of arguments we  have had the last few days. It's not easy doing his job most of the time. That""s why most of us call him daddy. ",0
  Friday morning about 6:45am Jim called me on the cell phone.  Jim Wanted to know if i had cooled down yet and wanted to talk  about what had happened the day before  he asked if I really  wanted to quit or just said it out of anger  I told him that  at times he just pisses me off to know end  amd I was sorry  I stormed out like that and for what I had said and that I really didn't want to leave my job.  He told me to come to work and at the end of the day we could  talk about it.  Pic of the BOSS.               So I got ready and went to work  but we never did talk about  it at the end of the day. ,0
  Well  it's finals week and you know what that means! THE NBA PLAYOFFS ARE HERE! No but seriously  what can be more stressful than finals week? I don't know....maybe not having any job leads for when you're done with school huh? Anyway  this is my first post so it sucks. Sorry. ,0
"  Well  I made it to graduation....sort of...After slipping by math with the scholarly final grade of a D minus  I acted like Chris Farley in the begginning of Tommy Boy and felt that it was neccesary to brag about my accomplishments to every man woman and child within a mile radius. Well  not really  but I did call most of my close friends and family. (If you're reading this and wondering why I didn't call you...get over it.) Commencement went well  except for the part where I got the case with no diploma inside!:) The weekend was great  except for when I found out that I had to change my living arrangments because of someone backing out of a contract. I won't name names  but his initials are Tim Taylor.. (No hard feelings Tim :))Only four more weeks of college  and then I'll become as close to democrat as possible so that I can freeload off of society and milk the government for all it's worth until I finally land a job. At this point  any chance of actually landing a journalism job seems about as realistic as bumping into Tom Hanks at Merritt Square Mall. (I'd say more like...one in a million.'- 'So you're telling me there's a chance!'- Dumb & Dumber) Speaking of Merritt Square  the new theater there is amazing. As my good bud Stacey said  the theater's motto should be: Cobb 16- ""Can you believe you're in Merritt Island?"". We saw day after tommorow and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and they didn't really push an agenda like all the media was saying they would. That's truly a first! Well  I've already typed way more than anyone would want to read so I'll stop. ",0
  Ok  so summer school officialy sucks. My sanity is seriously dwindling with each day. At the same time  I'm not so sure that I'm ready to leave college behind. Not a good situation to be in. Go Pistons! ,0
  Languages are really an amazing thing. They can differ so much  or so little  and they open up so much about the world and culture that speaks them. Languages are so much deeper than many people give them credit for  but they are an essential part of the human experience. If we didn't have language  we wouldn't be human. ,0
  There are two days left until my school closes for the summer. I have two more days of pointless classes  as we've finished the year up already. A party in Deutsch I and I have to listen to speeches on controversial topics in World Studies  and I suppose I have to write a speech tonight so that I can give it tomorrow. I should get doing the research now  because it'll take awhile  but I have other  more pressing matters  like writing in my blog  vacuuming my room  changing my cat's litter  all that good stuff. And finding my remote. I was watching one of the newschannels  and the news guy was interviewing this woman on the recent phenomenon in America of organization  with shows like Clean Sweep  and stuff  and she was talking about how people spend a certain amount of time everyday looking for something when they could be doing something that they really want to do  and while she was saying that  I was desperately looking for my remote. It was ironic. I still need to find that remote. ,0
  Now that it's the middle of July  and my best friend is in California for the entire month  and my computer doesn't have internet  I feel really strange. It's like lonely  but not necessarily bored. Last week I rented Prince of Persia: Sands of Time for my Gamecube  and even kept the game past its due date  to finish it  it was that good. So I'm not necessarily bored. Like tonight  for instance  I finished 'Lucky'  by Eddie de Oliveira (he's cute). It was a really good book  and I'm glad I read it. However  now that the game is played  and the book is read  I seriously need something more to do. I hoped to have a job by now  but then  I had also hoped to be going on student exchange this autumn  but it's amazing how  no matter how hard you try  some plans just refuse to come to fruition. It's neurotic. ,0
  I live and work by the beach in the Bay in Northern California. Originally from the South I had this preconceived notion that coastal living was  well  awesome - hot all of the time with the warmest water imaginable.   HA!  Someone forgot to informs me that the water temperature drops as you live further up North and that the Pacific Ocean isn't nearly as balmy as the Atlantic. Duh.  Uh  and can we please talk about the fog? Horrid little overcast that can last for hours on end. It's the coast! It's suppose to be sunny. Was Baywatch a lie?  (Not that I ever watched Baywatch  mind you.)   Fog  water temperature at 54 degrees  not exactly the sunny California I was hoping for. It's definitely not OC.   Unbelievable. ,0
  Living in California I discovered a wonderful sport - Rugby. I know  I know what you must be thinking. Extreme pain. Trust me  the way girls play  it's not painful. It's like tackle football with the guys back in the South. If you don't want to land on the ground  just find somebody and land on them.  I can run pretty fast  so I'm a center (in a full squad of Rugby I play outside Center). Summer 7's (that's 7 minute halves  with 7 players on a full field) is geared for the backs and I absolutely love it! It's the closest I'll come to playing contact football  without the protection (mouth guard is it baby).  I play with some of the girls on the San Jose State team. They are a bit whacked (yes  Virg  I'm talking about you  and you Kelly). Last year on Thursday nights we'd practice on the beach then head over to the Beach Boardwalk and ride the roller coaster (and while most people hung on to the safety bar  Virg hung onto her breast  to each their own  I guess  Virg you little freak).   So far  on our first tourney we won all three games. I was unable to play because I popped a blood vessel in my eye.  I know what you are thinking - Ew.   Trust me  I ran for my phone so fast to call my eye doctor  Holy Toledo. I wasn't in pain  just had this HUGE bubble of blood in my eyeball  well  that's gone but there is a sea of blood around my eye now.  Of course I now go around freakin' everyone out. My rugger mates told me to come up with a creative story  that taking my contact out wasn't good enough... so here goes:  Two guys  one small room  very little time... ,0

  Ever notice how the end of the school year is both exhilarating and a real let down? I spend an entire year teaching students to be better thinkers  writers  and people  yet only some of this shows through. Your high achievers get better  some of your middle achievers improve  and a lot of students just stay the same.  Behavior is at an all time low at this point too. Since my fifth graders don't have finals  thye've been tuning me out for the last three weeks. It's terrible. Although there is little I can do about it  I just hope that something of the knowledge and behavior skills that I taught remain with them. Maybe my modeling good behavior might just rub off on them in the long run. Who knows? Anyway  it has been a long year and I am ready for it to end. Thank God it ends next week! ,0
"  ""Marriage  Marriage is what brings us together  today."" -- The Princess Bride      Women can be frustrating. My girlfriend and I just had a very important discussion two weeks ago about getting married. She then left to go on vacation for two weeks with her family. Since she leff  I keep thinking that she will say she doesn't love me and doesn't want to marry me. I've told her I love her and that I want to marry her but haven't yet proposed.      She is the type that likes to know all about what's going to happen before it happens. So she asked me all about the future and what I think about when we should get married and what will happen after that. I told her I want to marry her in December. She objects because she is a school teacher (like me)and that is a busy time of year. I'm okay with doing it another time (like June) but I love her so much and want to begin my life with her right now.      Anyway  I'm ultimately worried that she will get scared and run away. But I'm probably being stupid and untrusting. She cares very much for me and I know that for sure  so I should just be content with that. ",0
"  [Ignore Timestamp]  I do believe the weekends over and what a stonned one it was too. I knew this was going to be a weekend to remember a while back. It was the weekend of my cousins marraige in norway  the one which my elders were invited to  and due to  unfortumate  circumstances I had to stay at home with my siblings. ""What a disapointment"" I exclaimed to my mothers as she reveled the  bad  news to me.  This was some months before and I proceded to get the arrangments in place for everything to flow on the night. I meet with friends and explained the situation  and told them it was only open to those with vocal invite. So now my usual crowd where coming and there was still room for more. I enthusasticly phoned around and invited more 'less seen' friends.  By now there it was already looking towards being a party to remember. And we hadn't even discussed the gear that was going to be passed around. Of the 15 that I invited  8 [including me] where to chip in together  4 wanted there own through me  and the other 3 where bringing along the own shiznic.   To Be Continued ",0
  I'm all alone in my house tonight... I'm planning to get round to doing one of the many projects I have stuck in my head. I might start work on the weed community forum Highgrounds that I've been planning to do for ages. Or I could finally sort out my music collection and tag all the songs properly  so I can put them on CD's. But more then likely I'll go watch ' urlLink Fight Club ' and once again spend a night sat doing sweet fuck all.  N2S [Note 2 Self]: Compulsory revision tomorrow... Don't lie to yourself. ,0
  This is my first post of what will hopefully be many. I was contemplating writing a blog for about 2 weeks but I fiqured I ain't got anything to lose. I plan on writing about anything thats of interest to me and somethings that don't. This blogs really just for me to keep a record of anything interesting but its free to read by others so if your here now you might as well read on. Generally i'll be going on about websites if checked out  music i've heard  games i've played and some non-specific bullshit. There isn't much else to say on the subject... ,0
"  As I write this  It is the end of a very long day. Toady  Saturday  May 15th is the first blog posting I have ever done  some of you who read this will go  big deal it's just TwistBs or TwistTim or however you know me posting  others will say  why did he not write sooner?  The answer is late last night I finally found out how great this service truly is. I had heard about it before but didn't think it would be any good.  How did I hear about this? Lockergnome.com's Windows Digest  I have been a subscriber from earlier on...96 I think was my first issuse  I left readership for a while  but came back  I had to leave it to focus on school  I came back because I reliazed all the tools I could find in there  amongst the stuff that didn't fit me was useful. even what didn't fit me could have a benefit to someone else.  I will conclude this post with two of my favoriate quotes.  One : ""Never give in  Never  Never  Never  Never - in nothing great or small  large or petty  never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense"" - Wintson Churchill Two : ""Do not medle in the affairs of dragons  for that are crunchy and taste good with Ketchup."" - Unknown. Check out my site sometime  Http://www.geocities.com/twisted_balloons. also if you use StumbleUpon(Http://www.stumbleupon.com) look for me - Twistbs. ",0
  That's Right  my site Http://www.geocties.com/twisted_balloons/  will be updated soon and the new improved version should be on-lined by tuesday or wensday at the latest. preferablly tonight  but realistically  it will be up tommorow night  as it will take me time and I have to be off-line during the day due to phone constrants.  When it is updated let me know what you think of the new look  go ahead and check it out now and let me know what you think of the current  very basic look as well.  TwistBs Signing off for another night. ,0
  I didn't mean to not update my website  I really will get it done soon  I had other things happen  like lack of desire  however I promise now that I have pleanuty of content I will update it soon. ,0
  i will start to go away     i want to say i am a free man now. i don't want to hurt anyone. specially not her coz i have hurt her a million times. as it is  i don't know if i am  i guess i am. but she's getting by. her pride and probably her resolve to make things work for her is getting her by. though i know deep inside she's hurting. because of me.  i know how i can make her really happy. but i just cannot do it now. most especially now that i have to clear out certain issues about myself.  i am contented to see her happy  no matter how contrived it is. i know she's not  deep inside she's not. but something tells me she's on her way there. she can make things work for herself. so i believe i am ready to leave her now for good. maybe slowly  i will drift away. and never bother her.  we'll finally have our separate lives. maybe once in a while i will check on her. i hope i can let her be. let her find her own peace. i will leave her for good. ,0
  august  3  my thoughts are filled with just getting out  leaving everything behind. maybe i am a walking contradiction. there is no other way for me but to lead. here i am now. leading. the pressure is getting too much. sometimes i feel like this is not me anymore. i hate some stuff i am obliged to do. smile here  smile there. give commendations. be a people person. i fucking hate all these crap.  there are times i want to be left alone. i want to have some quiet time. i want to do my thing. in spite of myself  i realized all i want to have is a low profile life. a quiet life. maybe that's why i wasn't too keen on modelling. people are so nosy. and i couldn't just smile when asked to. i just want to do my thing. i want to sleep when i want to  i want to wake up no matter how late. i want to dress up the way i want to  i hate ties  i hate looking so yuppy. i want to curse whenever i feel like it. i will be friendly when i want to  i will be nice when i feel like being nice.  show me the light please as i am about to go nuts where i am now. ,0

  I have a lot of kids  the fur baby kind. I love each and every pet I meet. That doesn't necessarily mean that I WANT each and everyone that I meet  because I don't. I believe that they all need to have their OWN homes where they are special. To me they are all special. It can be very hard to make all the cats  feel  special and I do try to make them feel that way. I don't like to see them broken hearted when a new one arrives. That causes me stress. Sometimes new arrivals require alot of attention and the other cats get their feelings hurt and start to shy away. That breaks my heart too. Plain fact is that I need help. I need foster parents to take in orphaned babies so they can be adopted. At work we get so many calls of people finding orphaned kittens and the shelters here are full. I can't take them because my sancutary cats have been exposed to FIP. If they come here they have to stay forever. I already found 5 orphaned kittens myself. I had no where to send them so now they are here to stay. Anyone out there want to help bottle feed babies? If you do and live in Pensacola  FL call me: 261-0760 or 492-6878. I will start a list and give notice at work that I have foster families! That would be too cool! Those of us that work in a Vet Office  we are there because we LOVE what we do and we LOVE animals. Believe me  the pay isn't that great! We have our hearts broken weekly and sometimes several times a day. It is an emotional business  protecting and saving lives. ,0
  This is a place that we can talk about the 'babies' in our lives that are our best friends. Our fur babies  the ones we depend on the brighten our lives  the ones who depend on us for their own exsistence. ,0
  The new kittens are doing great! They are over their bout of Calisivirus and are tearing through the house. Exploring every corner  every piece of furniture  every other cat or dog  and of course any plate  cup or glass they can get their paws on  head in. Kittens are such fun. Why don't you go out and adopt one or two today? ,0
"  this is the first time i ever done one of these  it seems a little awkard for me considering i'm such a shy person  But i feel its something that i need  no one listens anymore.  Its like there deaf to everything i say  i'm going unheard....its a really painful feeling.  i heard a song today by story of the year  ""anthem to out dying day""  it was a song that appealed to me in no sort of reason  but i still felt compelled to do something.  i have listened to it non-stop for about 2 hours and it still hasn't gotten old for me.  Its a new one for me considering i like songs for about a week then never listen it for awhile.  i don't know what but it appeals to something in my life  something i've been wanting for awhile.....her. she is one of the most perfect people i have ever seen i my life. She lights up my entire life when ever i am near her.  its like nothing i've ever felt  and it aches...because i can't tell her how it feels...how will she react?  she is the type of person that isn't very open...like me.....i can't just tell her ""hey i love you baby!""  that just won't cut it  for me and for her.  It seems like she wants something more in a relationship  something i'm trying to find and seem to have found  but can't tell her.  Will she reject or rejoice?  I know it seems like a cliche type of love story but that is just the way this story is.  I wish she would just run into to my arms and say  i love you and nothing is never going to change that.  My heart grows heavy when i see her with other people...other men...i always feel like my window is closing to her..like i'll miss my shot..and i will....i just can't do anything about it.  I won't too  but i just can't.  I don't want to ruin what we already have.  I keep thinking that she will freak out and our relationship will never be the same with her.  Its a solitary confinement for me.  No windows  only a door  which i'm afraid to open  afraid to see whats on the other said.  Something lies beyond the door that i want too see  but i am afraid too...what happens if disater lurks beyond the door... ",0
  I was sitting at dinner with a few of my friends  and the conversation turned (as it often does) to the war in Iraq. WWI  WWII  Vietnam? It was always the young men who were sent out to fight. Young men like me.  I don't want to fight. I don't want to die.  Has the world lost its senses? ,0
  You've gotta wonder whether anyone really trusts the government... I mean  who would trust a bunch of guys who have thousands of dollars each in superannuation  but no money to spend on health?  Who reckoned this war thing was a good idea  anyway?  I mean  brainstorm the word WAR...  Bombs  Guns  Bombers  Fighter Jets  Warships  Soldiers  Politics  Religion  Pillaging  Hate  Pain  Theft  Loss  Killing  Murder  Rape  Death  Destruction  Does anyone see anything happy about that list? (N.B. If your answer was yes  seek professional help.) ,0
  Just last night I was watching the news and the headlines said that the man who was running the government in Iraq is dead. Assassinated by a bomb. Someone said to me after hearing that 'Well  Iraq's not going to go away in a hurry!' I want it to go away and leave me to my life.  You've gotta wonder what goes through the head of someone just before their car explodes. ,0
  Anyway  I can't sit around raving about the government all day.  I had a driving lesson today. God - that guy's insane! He had me (on my second lesson  mind - and I've never driven before!) bombing around Constitution Hill at 50km/h! I almost had a heart attack. Luckily  'though  I didn't  and I'm still here to type all of this to you. Yeah  well  I suppose that scaring the shit out of your students is one way to ensure that they don't drive like idiots when you let them out onto the road after they get their licences. I mean  my best mate had his P plates for two weeks before he had his first accident - and I don't mean a little scraping  either! I'm talking a major  hi from hospital  thank god you've still got your legs deal. He couldn't walk properly for ages.  Makes you think  'though - when we are more likely to die violently and horrifically than any other age group  is the price we pay for a tank of petrol really that important?  Thought for the day: Did they call Bali an act of God? ,0
  Well I do not have any high hopes about this blog since it is my first one!  I shall just ramble a little bit and then go looking at the other capabilities of this site.  Currently I am sitting in work winding away my time until dinner.  It is a beautiful day today and I have my office window open  my office is situated below the canteen  the food smells are wafting down and making my tummy rumble.  My lunch today is of the packed lunch variety  cheese sandwich  plain crisps and a flapjack.  Not very healthy I know.  It was made in haste this morning as  my car was parked in  a space that was not paid for outside my flat!  Well after that initial interesting reverie regarding the delights of my lunch  I will sign off!  Greetings to all.  Bo xx ,0
  Well  this is my second blog  this time I am having a go posting via e-mail!!  What have I been up to?  Well last night I drove home and as it was so sunny I decided to take some pictures of my building to show my Grandma when I next go home.  I rang my Grandma and my sister Sindy.  I have agreed to move in with my sister next year and her boyfriend Art  if I dont they will have to move.  Their house is really nice  plenty big enough and it would be wonderful living in London.  Plus I think I will feel more settled down there.  It would be good for Art too as he will be able to use my car.  I dont have a job lined up but I have my long term plan sorted:  Temp/bar work and apply for proper jobs  if I dont get proper job by January  apply for teacher training.  Itll be fine..  Last night I also worked on a website for work a little bit and then watched TV.  My house is a tip so tonight I think tonight I will do lots of cleaning and tidying.  I have an interview on Friday for which I should really be revising  but you know  tidyings better than revising (ask any student!!)  Well today the sun came out again bright and hot.  Its sad being stuck in an office on a day like this.  Id love to be stretched out  outside with a book.  Ho hum.  Today is a quiet day at work  this afternoon I may take some more images of phantoms with the gamma camera but for now Ill just sit here and try and do some theory.  Roll on the weekend I say!!! ,0
  so my friend debbie does this and I thought that it could be good for me. Sometimes I feel like I have to be a certain way for certain people and I thinkt that I need some place that I can just be myself. With no one judging or telling me what to say or what not to say. Today the 3 year old was really cranky and all I wanted to do was go back to bed. It drives me nuts when the parents are here and just don't do anything. I mean what is the point? well I am going to go get some stuff ready.. yea later ,0
"  ok so today has been a pretty good day considering.... The other nanny is going to be gone for the whole day and the baby nanny really doesn't help me all that much... none of the kids were in bed before 9:30 (not my fault) and the mom is home. This morning was fine the kids and I were joking around all the way to school so the day started off with laughs and smiles. Then I took the 3 year old to pre-school and we had no problems... I picked him up we had a good lunch and afternoon he fell asleep right away for his nap and the mom is picking the kids up from school..    I found out yesterday that I passed the praxis which is huge for me cuase now I am a certified teacher in the state of Ohio. Whew!! I also got a call on my way to play practice (more about that later) about a job at a school really close to my home town. I am so excited. The principal isn't even asking me to apply just send her a resume and plan on going in for an interview. I had done an experience there and she wants to hire me.. I am almost about to burst!!  I leave for Fl in like 5 days and I am so ready for it!!   so I have been going to this church here and there are these 3 great fun guys my age there. Well the pastors wife  youth pastors wife and the church secretary have all decided that they want me to stick around here. So it has recently been their goal to hook me up with one of these guys. nice huh... Well I was asked to be in this skit for friend day at church and yup sure enough they are all in it adn I am ""married"" to one.. yup... so any time I see one of the ladies they say something and i turn bright red.. yea nice..   So Josh Dailey is coming to visit me for the weekend and I am super stoked!! I can't wait to have some fun and see him!!!!  Praise you Lord for the weekend.... ",0

  Ever been bogging?  Put on a pair of old sneakers  clothing you don't mind getting wet and lets go for a walk.  As you step out onto the bog it is like stepping out onto a waterbed made of moss.  Your feet sink into the ground as water fills in the whole. It is a creepy but wild experience.  If you dare you can walk right out till you are waste high or go over your head.  Now you may ask what does this have to do with a Blog?  Absoultely nothing but being as much of an environmental science nut as I am  it was the first thing that jumped into my mind...  So feel free to bog around!  Enjoy!! ,0
  Howdy everyone      I guess I have to find a way to write in this a bit more and keep things up to date however that is somthing I am not always good about. Now that summer is here maybe if there is any exciting news I will post some info and see what is going on in my life.    So now that school is done and I have one course down and I have been to Burlington and back I now enter July.  THe month of unchartered waters. Who knows what this month will bring for me.  I am sure I will have many adventures but at the same time I am sure I will be busy with all the free time I have to deal with.  Today I finished one of my first summer craft projects. I redid my fun chair.  Oh it was so much fun and now I have a very nice light green sponge painted chair.  I think I should just go into home decorating and photography.  I guess maybe if nothing else I will use this as a gauge of what I get done this summer.  Well I hope to get my puzzel I got started and done. I am working on ideas for my classroom. I get to work on bulletin board and decorating ideas. Oh the fun that is present in a summer off.    The 4th of July is here.. I think back to the two times I have not been in the US to celebrate the 4th. One year I was in Paris France at the Hard Rock Cafe and then 2nd time was this last year when I went to Australia for the Summer.  The 4th was the last day we spent in Port Douglass. We went out to Hog's Breath Cafe and had a blast with the bus driver.  OH the memories of July 4th past.  I also recall the year I went to my friends house and we had a hudge water fight and I got water dumped over my head.. Yeah many memories and I am sure more to be created yet this year.  Till next time keep on blogging and Happy 4th!  Cheers! ,0
"  Yup  today was just 'one of those days'.  Everyone has them  they are inevitable  along with many other things in life.  I woke up late  and isn't it funny  it seems that most days when u start them off bad by sleeping in when you shouldn't  they just go downhill from there.  It's true  observe your day next time you wake up late...  but it wasn't the small annoyances that made my day 'one of those days'... these small things such as being late for work  the kids being off  tripping over EVERYTHING  breaking my cell phone (on one of the trips )  and losing my keys just made the bigger things in my life... much BIGGER today... As I look on my life right now  it seems like utter chaos  and I don't like it.  I am trying to be strong  but lately I just don't know.  How do you gracefully walk away from someone you love no matter how right you KNOW it is  especially when you are sending them straight into the arms of someone else?? Between this  and many other things going on  I   for the first time in my life  feel completely lost.  And I spend a lot of time trying not to feel sorry for myself  sometimes it works  sometimes it doesn't.  I don't know how people can deal with so much WORSE  and it happens. Daily and in tragic ways.  So this pattern of thinking does put things in perspective b/c my life isn't exactly tragic  but my sentimental side tends to still succeed in getting in the way.  Anyway let's just say that after today  I hope I wake up one time tomorrow  so it's not another ""one of those days"" :) ",0
"  I am going to give this whole blog thing a try.  I have quite a few friends who do this  and I find it very entertaining to read some of their stuff. :)  I also think it may be kind of fun and refreshing just to get on here and talk and talk ;) no one can talk back! At least directly!  So we'll see how this goes  hopefully better than any attempt I've made at journalling! Here's to ""Amberitions""! ",0
  WAHOO!!!!! Way to go FLAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tho you proved me wrong again  it is a GOOD thing :) ,0
  These are just a few of the poems that I have written in my past.  Granted  they ain't the greatest  but in my eyes  they are also not the worst.  I hope if who ever does read these  enjoys them.     This first one I truely like.  Carpe Noctem By C. Kevin McBroom  Spinning yarns and  Spinning tales Of creatures of the night And of banshee wails  They say monsters do not exist Or at least so it seems Tell that to a small boys cries Or a little girls screams  As a clawed paw falls Quietly with each step Behind its opaque eyes  Many secrets are kept  The small creature stalks The night of the moon With nie a sound With a smell of doom  A light through a window Spurs the small beast on Moving swift ever silent For inside is food to feast on  A light scratch at the window Followed by a stifled cry Tis only a small kitten Wanting in from the cold outside  True Thoughts By C. Kevin McBroom  Im tired of peoples attitudes Treating me as if I am in their servitude People just dont understand Just because Im not Exactly as they have planned I feel as though Im looked down on Try as hard as I might Even when I win  I havent won Sometimes I want to Open that final dark door If I do  would I finally win?  Friends fall wayside  as do lovers Once again I am all alone Walking solemnly through the clover Pictures race through my mind I try not to look  is it Because Im afraid of what Ill find? Im better off left alone and silent No one to worry or care about No one for my heart to be sent Tears fall but I laugh in spite I close my eyes to hide myself And finally give up the fight      Personally I've always thought that one was kind of depressing  all suicidal and stuff  but for some odd reason  I still like it.  Seasons By C. Kevin McBroom  In the sleepy summer sunset  I remember your bright eyes Reassuring and softly staring Reflective of the clearest blue skies  During the wild winter winds As the snow covered the ground We walked hand in hand At night you chased away the cold dark shroud  In sun-filled spring days Your lovely laughter filled the air As we rolled in and over the clover Life was without a single care  In the sleepy summer sunsets I remember your bright eyes       I wrote that last one for my now wife.  I know it is sort of corny and hallmark-ish (Is that a word?)  but I like the picture it brings to mind and it is probably the least syrupy poem that I wrote to her. ,0
  Well hello there... I know I'm being stupid to switch blogging sites  but I stumbled across this in my journey through the good ol' informsation superhighway today  and it looked pretty cool. (Don't bother pointing out that it doesn't have any more features that livejournal.com :-P I like the way this one *looks*  so nerrr). Still at TAFE... procrastinating... With you-know-who sitting next to me again. I'm already that close to strangling him. How am I meant to survive another one and a half years of this with *him* here??? It seems the more I try to avoid/ignore him  the more annoying he gets! Some people just don't get it. *big sigh* Still didn't have the rest of my team here to work on our group assignment today. Jeannie dubbed me team leader cuz I'm the only one who has a clue about what we're doing... and cuz I'm here. Was really looking forward to this project  but I'm already getting over it  cuz I don't think anyone else shares my enthusiasm for it  and so far I'm the only one who's seen the movie we're reviewing. (RUN LOLA RUN  for anyone who's interested. It's good stuff). So yeah  I'm just dawdling cuz I don't know what I'm meant to be doing with that and can't be bothered doing maths right now. I'm gonna get home this arvo and have to leave within half an hour cuz Michelle has got me teaching the tap class tonight before I go to my own jazz class. It's freaking me out a bit  but I don't think it'll be too hard... maybe even fun if I'm lucky! She says if I do well  she'll give me some more classes to teach  and I might end up replacing the current teacher she has (who isn't all that great). Ooh  note to self: remember to visit www.take40.com when I get home. *thumbs up* Can finally listen to stuff on the net now that we have ADSL. *scrolls up* Wow... I certainly had a bit of a ramble today! Maybe it's the new site. You gotta admit it's pretty funky! Anywho  I'm over it. Running outta stuff to talk about. I shall return. Bye for now! ,0
  I know that I am not alone in the 'loving the wrong man' line....   How many of us look for love in all the wrong places? How many of us confide in our best friends or our mothers (gasp!) that the man who is most important to us is unfortunately attached to someone else? How many of us intend for these things to happen? Probably none of us. We just seem to have a penchant for something that doesn't belong to us.....  And then I have to ask....does anyone really belong to anyone but themselves? Shouldn't we belong to ourselves? Shouldn't we do as  we  see fit?  No.... probably not. Because we harm others when we do this. Actually we harm ourselves  our psyches  our very souls.  We show ourselves to be without value. We are unimportant. We don't count. And we do this to ourselves.    Do we want to hurt others? No. I don't think that most of us even have any guilt about what we are doing. The man certainly doesn't. I seem doomed to be someone's midlife crisis. And no I am not that young. I am 48 years old and once again in the throes of a relationship that can only damage everyone involved.    He wants my address so that he can send me things. He actually called me once from his home. I asked him if he was out of his fucking mind. I don't know why I am doing this.  Because he smells so wonderfully fine and he tastes so good. Because he kisses like Kenny G's music sounds. Because everyone I want seems to be married ....or gay. Yes folks.... the guy that did my eyebrow piercing is a definite hottie and has two grown kids and an ex-wife and is definitely  uncloseted. And he twinkles and flirts and makes you want to well......I don't know lick him or something....sometimes I hate men.  This one tells me that I am his 'Whiskey Lullaby'. I am not sure if that is a compliment or not. I love the song ...but it is rather depressing and I couldn't help but ask if I was the bottle or the trigger. I guess it is supposed to be a compliment....  Listen to me piss and moan.  If you don't like the heat......get out of the kitchen. ,0
  Well  today started off OK  I guess. Since my parents sold their restaraunt  they've been off for a bit  but my mom just started working part time at a green house about a minutes walk from my buddy's place. So I had to get up 6:30  which sucked. She dropped me off at school around 7:00. I was feeling OK  I got to the gym  one of the senior players was there. Talked to him for a minute or two  before I worked on some ball handling and shot around a bit.   I wasn't feeling it today  dunno what happened. Nothing seemed to be fallin'. Foul shot was off  the works. But you know  that happens sometimes. Some of the senior girls showed up  we shot around and talked for a bit. Nothing special. I finished off the morning with a game or twenty-one with this kid from my team named Chance. He's gotta be my favorite Rook' on the team. Seems a lot of the other ones are bitches. I was ice cold. I barely won the damn thing. I wasn't impressed at all.   Yeah  anyway  went to Math  got my test results back. 82%. Meh  I wasn't too excited  I wasn't disappointed  but I feel I could do better. Mark went up to 77%. I'm really underachieving this semester. Parents are riding me a bit. Then I went to English  lunch came  same old  same old. French  doing OK in that. Then I went to Socials  as usual Ms. Brown was a bitch.   Hopped on the bus  went home  wasn't feeling great. Came on the computer did some shit on here. Then I went and watched Sacramento play Minnesota. I was not impressed with that missed lay-up by C-Web. Cost 'em the mother fuckin' game. Garnett was nuts  as usual.   MVP style. MVP class. MVP ability.   He's a sick mother fucker I'll tell ya that much. After the game was done I watched the end of the Calgary  San Jose game. Man  everyone here in Van-City has jumped on the Calgary bandwagon and I'm pissed OFF. They're going to the Cup  everyone couldn't be happier  except me. Bastards.   Anyway  that's today for ya. Catch ya later.   -J ,0
  Why is it that when ever something goes wrong or when there is some one to blame I seem to be the one every one turns to. I don't know if it is just me or if there is othere people who feel this way. For me it is hard to deal with and its sad to say  but i'm actullay not looking forward to summer vaction. Summer vaction for me is usually the worst for me because I live a way from all of my friends which means i get to spend the time with my family. The happest for me would probley be at school when i'm around people who don't judge me. My friends known or I try to remind them that what i say that is mean is just kinding around  but thats different here with my family. To me it seems that know matter what i do or what i say i feel like I can never do anything right. I'm not trying to make it seem like my life is all bad or anyhting like that I have good times and bad times but for me it seems that the bad happens more often then the good. ,0
  Well its Summer again and well. There is nothing I have plan to do this summer which makes it seem like summer will last for ever. Only 2 more years left and our group will disappear. We all have plans for the future and some can't wait to get there others are wishing it won't come. To think this is one of the 2 last summers left before we'll be on our own. Me I don't know what I want to do exactly I just know I want to do some thing useful. Any ways so far this summer I've watched the Dead zone (a very strange twisted show) went fishing caught nothing and watched the monk marathon season premiere starts in a hour and a half yeah.:/ ,0
  It's the middle of summer and I can't sleep  I haven't talk to my friends in a while I wonder what they been up to. Anyways I've leaned something this summer about me. One thing being why I feel depressed and why I get irritate easily. I've discovered that when I'm not with a crowd of people I don't feel depressed or get irritate easily. Which is like my brother which sucks because all school is a crowd of basically adults acting like 6 year olds. ,0
"  O.K.  It looks as though i have a blog.  WHat i mean to say is... this is my blog  or the blog that is this  belongs to me.  After an excrutiating million trillion billion hours of trying to find an adress that wasnt taken  i got one. It's something like: arg stop being unavailable  and  LO AND BEHOLD.... (success).  THus begins my journey into blogging and being blogged in return... I wonder if when you say ""blogging"" it has the double consanant  or if it just holds its own against the common rules of the english language and presents itself as a non-double consanant word.  Whew... I'm spent  time to get off to my REAL friends  Zola on aol... shes a blast. She calls me jesus or satan or even calafornia (that is if i wanted her to.)  I;m refering to a computer as if it were a person. Now i really need to go. ",0
  Who else loves the rain?  i know I do. And today it rained all day.  I got a chance to walk around barefoot in the woods in the rain.  I am at peace... However  tomorrow I have to get a brain scan... That ought to be a blast! nnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooootttttttttttttt. Last time I did that they made me hold my breath whenever the scanner went over me.  And the tube was really cold  yecch.  I hope all goes well  I really would rather not hear that I need some sort of surgery.  But if I do have surgery there is a pro  I get HOSPITAL SOCKS!!!!  Those are so nice  they have the little sticky pads on the bottom  and they are ever so warm.  The con of the situation is having to wear a gown.  I always imagined having to wear one  and waking up after anesthesia with a face drawn on my butt secretly  damn doctors..... I'm off te finish me book. g'night ,0
  i've got a lot to do this end of the year  and its not all that fun.  looking forward to having time to play the guitar a lot.  Fix up my blues  get the band working like the complex machine we should be.  I hope we can end up playing the quest.  i am listening to muddy waters.  What a guy.  If being sad is that soulful  i think i'll give it a shot.  This is strange  i feel like the closer i get to summer a certain feeling of nostalgia for the future occurs  even though it hasnt happened yet. sorry if that didnt make sense.      and his count of magical items had diminished by one...

"  I should probably start by telling you about who i am. My name is Amber and i have a great boyfriend named david.i am 15 years old but my life is crap.So let me tell you about that 5-16-04 some fat mexican chick wrote my boyfriend a note saying that she loved him well i took it and threw it away before david could read it well now she is giving me problems and matt came to the satirs at school today and said that girl that wants to steal your boyfriend is up here so i yelled really loud ""i ain't worried about it david thinks she's fat"" i yelled it loud enough to where she could here it!

  well today sucked i'm just glad that there is only 9 more days of school left. Why can't people just leave people alone. It's not like the world is doing them any harm i mean why do we all have to be judged why can't we al just get to know people for who they are i would have alot more friends that way i feel bad all the time because nobody knows who i really am they never want to thake the time out to get to know me they just asume that im a poser or that i'm a prep ora goth and i'm not i'm me i don't want to be anything more than who i am the only person tha understands me is my David and i'm really thankful for that i care about him alot and people don't care about me beig christian like matt he doesn't care he pretends to and then turns around and cusses right in front of me and makes fun of me but it's ot that i really care but it's hard to be nice to him and my old friends gracie myra and elizabeth could care less aout anybody unless it's them they don't understand anything or anbody thats why they always talk aboutpeople in spanish because their afraid of people and know that all they are is cowards wo pick on people who didn't do anything to them but tell the truth i mean thats hw i was raised and i don't care what they think i mean all they are are scared little mexicans i hate life its full of crap and the only sure thing in besides god is death and you can't really trust anybody except those one or two people and you can't even really trust them well i g2g ttyl ,0
  It is amazing how the time of lunch comes so slowly. At work the time seems so relative  that I feel like I understand Einstein's theory of relativity  and I could even make my own contribution if I hadn't been so hungy. Sugar levels are dropping. Concentration diminishing.  As I correctly predicted the weekend was indeed cold and rainy and on the weather side really nasty. I have seen all types of rain on that day  and I do not care to see them that soon again. But otherwise the weekend was great. I was training my fiancee in driving on our fresh new car and on Sunday we went to see Kill Bill vol. 2 to another country and it was good.  Today my sister is doing university graduation exams and it seems to be going well. Not for me though  because it is hard to type when you are keeping your fingers crossed :-) ,0
  So  it is Friday. I am at work hoping that I am successfully pretending to be working. I do hope it works. My current job is easy to spot. Just go to  urlLink Pravda.sk  and a lot of what you see is a result of my clicking and typing. Yes  you've guessed it right. I am an online journalist surfing the news agencies for the fresh news that I may together with my co-workers offer to the hungry Slovak online audience.   Today is one especially dull day as Fridays often are. So I watch the bubbles bubbling in my mineral water bottle on my desk. It is quite relaxing  but it makes me want to pee too often. That is the price you pay.  Fridays are often filled with expectations of the coming weekend  but not today. See the rason:  The forecast forecasts forbiddingly nasty stormy rainy ugly weather.   That would not worry me too much  but it has been so nice and hot during the working days when I just had to sit here and satisfy the hunger for the news of several thousands of people. Oh well  I should better be going... read you later. ,0
  One day this was bound to happen. So it is just as well that it is today May 21st 2004 that I open my very own blog. I hope I will enjoy it  and I hope you may all just as well. Keep your fingers crossed for me and my words. Soon you will know more about me than my email account knows  my personal page knows and my mobile phone knows. And that says something. So just keep your eyes on pavol.blogspot.com and you may be surprised. ,0
  I BELIVE IN LOVE   Singer  : Tata Young  Writer  : Martin Ankelius/Henrik Andersson/ Carola H?ggkvist  I feel the heat around me I feel the beat surrounds me Could this be for real  I wonder No need for hesitation It's time for celebration Will this be the night I've waited for   When angels fall in love Heaven knows  does it show  oh If this love  will last for eternity Set me on fire  (Chorus) I believe  I believe in love And like the stars above They shine  let it shine over me Set me free I believe in you And that our love is true Oh I believe  I believe   I see that people dancing Boys and girls romancing They want this to last forever   Cause underneath the moonlight Everything is alright We're reaching our hands up in the air   To where the souls alive Heaven knows  that it shows oh If this love  will last for eternity Set me on fire  (Chorus)  How could I doubt  what was meant to be Everything I needed was in front of me Your healing touch  will lift me up in the sky  so high  (Chorus) ,0

  What a whirlwind! My first trip since I've decided to try travel writing. I got a few articles started: one on dogs in Paris and another on a single woman's trip to paris (that would be me). You can see pictures from my trip and about the people I met at  urlLink www.lisabanks.com/Paris/Paris1.htm .  I'm still recovering. I caught a cold on the way back. The worst kind of souvenir. But this week I've had 3 new inquiries from my website  so work is still clipping along... ,0
  It's been 2 weeks  and still I long to be kissed on both cheeks when I meet someone! I want to turn around and go straight back to Paris.   But the ad agency where I work (www.adbiz.com) suddenly has more work coming in  and I've got two new projects on the go for freelance this week. One is search engine writing for a cosmetic surgeon's website. Another  an ad for building insurance. A lot more like this  and I'll be back in France in no time.  I've started on a couple more articles  about onsens and enkais in Japan and the glories of NS in the summer. But I have yet to finish one  since the paid stuff is taking up my time. That  and badminton! We started a club here in Gainesville  and we played for the first time two nights ago. It was fun. Some competitive people there  but for the most part  we just blissed out getting all sweaty (no a/c) and hitting the bird around.  Although it threw me for a loop when my French friend went to kiss me on the cheek instead of shaking hands after our first game. I got a little shy and forgot to do the second cheek. So we just resorted to the regular hand-shaking after that. ,0
"  My Japanese friends just got back from a visit to Toronto. They found the people there much more patient and easy to communicate with than here in Gainesville  FL. And Toronto is probably the most ""Americanized"" city in Canada. Another proof that Canadians are a more considerate breed.   But why is that all Canadians envy you when they find out you're in Florida? Most of them haven't lived here  that's why. Sure  3x the sunshine is nice. No snow is good  too. But if you ask me  the most important thing about a place is the culture of the people. Eager Canadians who head south for the warm weather will gradually come to realize there's no place like home.

  Anyone who hates barbie will love love love this site!  Here is a song me and my friend made up to make fun of Barbie:  Im a Barbie girl in the Barbie world. My hair is really real but my feet are just an ugly deal. Im really  really skinny but im not really worth money. Some people think im worth the deal and some think im a rip-off for real. My clothes are cool but dont go with me they just look good on my scene. Ohhh Im a Barbie girl in the Barbie world Im really fantastic and made of all plastic.  I have friends but my friends have better trends. I have a pet possum and hes so awesome. I am really  really weak and such a freak. I have lots of wrinkles and my hair is always crinkled. I can bark like a dog but it sounds like a frog. My hair is very rare because it has an ugly glare. I work for the news and everyone hates my shoes. I like hi heels but when I walk I look like an eel. I like to eat bugs because they rhyme with rugs. People say I talk too much and thats why the give me a little punch and people say I munch to much when I eat my nasty lunch. Im a Barbie girl in the Barbie world Im made of plastic its really fantastic. I have big ears and they give me lots of tears. I look really dinky just like a slinky. Im not a kitty because im not pretty. I look like porky the pig and I know how to dig. I have so much pettiness because Im so hideous when I got married I married something hairy that looked like my pet Gary. My very yellow hair looks like an ugly bear. Once I met the dairy fairy and she gave me my pet Gary. Im a Barbie girl in the Barbie world Im made of plastic its so fantastic. Some people say I look like a mouse and live in a tiny house. On Christmas day my mommy made me take an x-ray to see if I ate a stingray. Yesterday I got so cold that I turned into mold and thats why this is all I have to say.  Ohhh Im a Barbie girl in the Barbie world Im made of plastic its so fantastic. Ohh Im a Barbie girl in the Barbie world.   Barbie hater ,0
  This is my first blog ever!! woohooo! I guess your supposed to blab about random topics that enter your head around the time you actually are sitting and have nothing better to do. I guess this is one of those times... Ummmmm... I don't like Eggplant. Yup  eggplant.  Reason you may ask? Well  it tastes bad. Um  yeah. Its just bad. I mean it starts out all purple and ends up all white and squishy. Bleh. Uhh... I just realized that maybe this isn't the best topic for a first blog post  and that it is probably a bad topic all together. Soo... let talk about you! Wait  never mind. Thats worse then eggplant.  Well  if your actually reading this then... you should write a blog because you obviosly have nothing better to do.  Errrm... Bye? ,0
  My brother and I were at a mall yesterday with two of our closest friends  Carly and Jessica.  I realized something yesterday  no matter what has happened in our lives they have always been there through good and bad times.  I realized that whenever I need someone to talk to I have always been able to count on the twins to listen and to tell me their opinions.  They have always been at our house growing up  whenever school let out  they'd be over for sure. Its hard for me to think of days when they haven't been over at our house. The four of us have done practically everything together.   They are two of my true friends. I have very few friends that I could say that about.  Not many people know me as well as these gals. Now that we are getting older our lives will most likely be keeping us from seeing each other as much as we have in the past  but I know that no matter where we are we will be friends. They have meant so much to me in my life that I can't even explain to you in this one simple blog. I have tried my best to show you  but this is only a scratch of the surface of what these two mean to me. I just hope that I have been as good a friend to them as they both have been to me.  It is there birthday today and I just want to wish a happy birthday to two of the greatest people I know.  Happy 16th. ,0

I'm really quite tired  but I don't like to sleep during the day  cuz then i can never sleep at night!! anyways.. i got home from minneaoplis late friday night.  it was an exciting time.  i went to a science museum  which was kinda gay...but then we hit VALLEYFAIR!.. that was pretty sweet ass  except for the fact that it was RAINING outside.. kind of a suck deal. the most exciting time was when cc and me were standing in line behind sum fuckin stuck up bitch-kids... i said ""i had children  we shuld kill them.. then chop em up and eat em!""   and we then decided to make up foods like:  spaghetti and children balls  children noodle soup  Cambell's Cream of Children soup  McChildren Sandwhich (hold the mayo)  etc. :D it was halario!

  Woke up early to take my nephew to KKH for physiology. He is so adorable!! Came back home and later in the afternoon went for my hair appointment for free hair dye. And i have got free shampoo and conditioner too! Hehe.. Afterward I went to collect my cheque from the company for my pay. Went to coffee bean to sit and have coffee while waiting for my ex-colleguage. She was going to meet a prudential guy called george  so i tag along with them. In the end  went to China Jump to have dinner. Its indeed a very nice environment. It was my fourth time went there.  Later in the nite  Went to visit my friend at Tan Tock Seng Hopsital. After that we sent to relax and sit at the pool side to talk. This is the first time i have revealed some much about myself. ,0
  Life Sux! Another monday liao. What should i do? Being jobless for a long long time.. Wonder how long I am going to wait. Please God just give me a job!  Great News! Today the company had called me up for a second interview. Hopefully can get the job! So damn tired of waiting!:0 No $ No Job No Lover No Friends So Sick!!!! I wonder how life would be beautiful. NO life is Prefect.. Its just a matter of how you yourself going to deal with things and control it in your hands i believe. My life is in a mess now. I am really confused ! ,0
  Today is Thursday. Today went for my second interview! Woke up at 7.30am! Yuppy! Got the job! :P SO damn happy!  Went out for lunch with JN to Serangoon Garden for duck rice.  Later met Sam to go Town to Shop! Bought a halter black blouse for $15!  We had lunch at Far East Sq to eat Hot Plate Balacan Beef Fried Rice.. Too bad!  We sat at KFC outside to smoke and talk.. While talking  one man asked us whether if we mind to share seats with them. They were both Russian Guys who are seamen. I mistaken them as staff from siemens HAHAHA ! So damn funny! We had a chat with them. And the guy sitting next me was so damn close to me while chatting with me! Sam got worried and asked us to leave first. HAHAHA . What a day! ,0
"  this title is more of what i am looking for than what i am offering. i was looking for a way to start some good conversations on this topic but was unsure as to where i should go to do so....until now. so  that is what i am wondering. personally  i think that for the most part  the church has missed the point over the last 500 years or so but this has become more evident in recent years  as illustrated by this excerpt from ""Blue Like Jazz"":       ""In a recent radio interview I was sternly asked by the host  who did not consider himself a Christian  to defend Christianity. I told him that I couldnt do it  and moreover  that I didnt want to do defend the term. He asked me if I was a Christian and I told him yes. Then why dont you want to defend Christianity? he asked  confused. I told him I no longer knew what the term meant. Of the hundreds of thousands of people listening to his show that day  some of them had terrible experiences with Christianity  they may have been yelled at by a teacher in a Christian school  abused by a minister  or browbeaten by a Christian parent. To them  the term Christianity meant something that no Christian I know would defend. By fortifying the term  I am only making them more and more angry. I wont do it. Stop ten people on the street and ask them what they think of when they hear the word Christianity and they will give you ten different answers. How can I defend a term that means ten different things to ten different people? I told the radio show host that I would rather talk about Jesus and how I came to believe that Jesus exists and that he likes me. The host looked back at me with tears in his eyes. When we were done  he asked me if we could go get lunch together. He told me how much he didnt like Christianity but how he had always wanted to believe Jesus was the son of God.""    i am not saying that i disagree with the teaching of Jesus nor with that of the Bible but rather with the fundamental ring-wing Christianity of the 20th century. what are your thoughts on christian spirituality?

  Hi pplz!  I just started this blog thing and I have to learn how to use it. Today is a school free day.  It is boring  but some friends are coming over and I have no idea why...I want to go swimming. Last weekend  I went to Callaway Gardens (which was boring)  the mall (stayed the whole frikin day  my feet hurted a lot!)  Asian Square (got a fan with calligraphy written on it)  the movies (saw Troy)  I made a Dir en Grey CD  washed my aunts car (got paid $10)  and tasted a Latte from Dunkin Donuts for the first time  those damn lattes are strong! I wanted a Donut! But I was broke. Damn. Hope today will go fine... ,0
"  Today when I woke up  I got yelled at by my dad over the phone for oversleeping. He told me that I had to go and make something for my sisters to eat  because they are hungry! I was like tired  because I had like stayed up till 3 am trying to fix my damn ghetto computer. I made something for them to eat  but one of them didn't want to eat. I got so pissed and I made her eat. She ate it and everything went fine. Then I decided to fix my computer and I tried installing another version of XP on it. It almost broke down. I was so totally freaked out! I mean god damn! Then Thomas had to call and I had to go over to Sloan's house cause he just got a multi tap. (like I cared if i he just got one!). Well I went anywayz and had a really lame time. I am not really good at video games  I mean fighting games. We then played an NBA game and I totally sucked at it. I suck at the real thing  what makes them think that I could play a fake version? When I got home  my computer was fixed and I was happy. But then I had to defrag it and I was pissed. Then I went to the upstairs computer and I started to type in my blog! I had to fix the internet connection first. While typing this  the TV said that Linkin Park has a new video coming out and it is one of my favorite songs. ""breaking the habit"" and there is a making the video at 6 pm tomorrow (i think) and I am totally psyched that they have a new video! So now i feel bored.  OMG it is a linkin park video and i am totally wanting to watch it  damn  my mom turnt it away! DARN!! Well  i dont like that vid much anyways. I have to defrag this computer now  S'later pplz! ",0
"  Woohoo! My Very First Blog. I'm so happy. Now I'm gonna' spill my heart out like a naive little 3 year old! Or something like that.  So Today was the last actual day of school. I'm so happy  now we've got finals to do. What fun. I've got Japanese and Computer Literacy. We did nothing at school today whatsoever. It was really retarded  but it was fun  cause the teachers were somewhat intimidated and forked over tons of candy in a last ditch to maintain some semblance to order.  It worked.  During Science  M*rr*s (take that Google!) was a meanyhead  making me take the darn remote and fast forward through commercials  then count field trip money  then do this  and that  and so forth. Me no like M*rr*s. Oh well. SHE'S GONE FOREVER FROM MY LIFE AFTER THIS. I'm so freakin' happy.  History was kinda' stupid  but Micah and I chased each other around  and Ms. Yi got pissed. Japanese was kool  cause Austin and I got to sumo wrestle or something like it. Everyone was goofing off. It was awesome.  CS  I was locked in a room with Sm*th for a whole period. I was scared. He's still pissed at me  I think. Here's where background is required. He was dissing Mozilla (!)  and how they were heralding ThunderBird as the next generation of email thing. Then he proceeds to diss all of Mozilla  including Composer and FireFox. Then  the final straw  he calls ThunderBird FireBird. So I tell him he's wrong and tell him that FireBird was the 1st generation of the  FireFox browser. He just kinda' stares at me. So I'm not sure whether he was really  really pissed or amazed that someone as computer illiterate as me would know that.  Skipping all other classes  I get to English with B*l*sta  8th Period. I tried to behave in class  and this is the 4th day of the year that I managed to actually pay attention!!! But I got this pencil  and wrote on my binder  ""Blinder than a Mother-Freakin' Doorknob"" with an arrow pointing to my right.   Ms. B*l&sta walks over and has her back to me. She gives a really long  like  5 minute lecture with me holding this next to her. It was picture perfect  and Micah nerly died laughing. No kidding.  At home  I IM'd and got in fights w/ my parents. Nothing else                                         Lotsa' Love (or something like that) ",0

"  My first blog.. Man I used to wonder what a blog really is and now am blogging  ;o)  ... I am techie from india (I know nowadays being a techie from India is very dangerous) slogging out ... enjoying myself...But have some serious doubts about certain new things that I am discovering...  Quality  is a wonderful sounding word and my initiation into Project Management exposed me to a world of  jargons  metrics  templates and of course complete non-sense . I know that I may be chided for writing that  but let me clarify. On the set I am a devotee (right word) of the world of mathematics which never ceases to amaze me and Statistics  cos its just wonderful. During one of the great training days  it was conveyed  Statistics shouldn't be employed to misrepresent the data and now I wonder if it is the whole process is to do so. Information is available very abundantly and I guess we have surplus than we can consume. I wonder if generation of information is the basis of quality. Which comes to my first question ? Does adhering to quality standards mean ""keep your common sense @ home and come"". I wonder if the purists of statistics are the ones to satisfy. Cmon.. I wonder what possible information can be derived out of one's coffee breaks  one's mails and definitely the winner  How many lines of code I can dish out ? wonder if they know that I can eternally keep on putting braces  new lines  comments  star  hashes etc and they all contribute to code. Yeah Yeah I know  we have tools that can take care of these  but is this an indicator of a person's ability... Wonder what good is the information for... Begs the second question.. I get the common answer.. information may be useful down the line.. Yes it may be and may not be.. Going by the theory of probability it is equi-probable... I guess quality is used to ensure that the product being manufactured is in accordance with the best-practices in the industry (for starters) and more importantly  you learn from your current process to refine the same.. I think refinement is the catch and I guess it can be done in more than one way than generate some junk metrics..Wonder how the process can be refined from measuring no. of lines dished out in a day... Look forward to people's views... Hey feel free to drop in and drop a line... Hope this blog goes a long way... Time to hit off... ",0
  This is going to be a place for me to vent and keep people up to date with my life.  If anyone is interested:)  I have to go rearrange my living room now so tata. ,0
"  Well it started of ok  I did some exercising.  Then I went to the drug store to price the perscription I have been carrying around with me  and had never gotten it filled.  I found out to have it filled it would be 130$.  My god what do they think I am made of  Money? Well anyway  I won't be getting that anytime soon.  Then when I came home Pat made a really good stir fry for supper.  But then Karmen was really cranky tonight and my cat got hit by a car.  The cat's ok though so that was good. I have had such a day of ups and downs. But I am still able to say I had an ok day.  I still don't know how to post pictures on here.  But when I can I will put a picture of my beautiful baby doll.  She is positively gorgeous.  I have a job interview next week and I am really nervous. I don't know how well it will go with no voice  and I get nervous in interviews.  When I get nervous I ramble.  So I have started preparing I have over 200 questions I am going to plan the answers too  I am going to plan the questions I am going to ask them at the end and I am researching the company.  That is all I can do besides remembering to breathe.  I just feel I have to make an extra big impression perferably on the good side  since I don't have much of a voice.  So any advice you can give me for my interview would be great:) I hate interviews.  I can write wicked resumes and a good coverletter  but I suck at the talking to people. They intimidate me  and I can not seem to picture people in their underware no matter how hard I try. I never know what to wear to interviews either.  I always feel like I am under dressed for them.  I don't own a ""business suite""  what I have are dressy clothes but to me they don't scream interview clothes.  Anyway I think I have rambled enough for today. ",0
  Why is it when something negative comes my way I run and hide? I push away all the people that I truly care about  and I  crawl in to a dark closet with in my mind and slowly shut down. I still to this day don't know how to take rejection when all my life its all I had you would think id be used to it by now  I was never good enough for my mother all the guys I dated treated me like shit  what did I do to deserve this? All I ever wanted was to be loved unconditionally  now I see my self unable to give the love that is needed to my beautiful daughters  why cant my daughters love be good enough for me? Why do I need the love and approval of a man to  fulfill me ?? I just don't understand  where I went wrong in my life! ,0
"  I started talkin to this awesome guy I had met on  plentyofish.com about  two weeks ago we would talk every night for at least 5 hours a night.  He seemed to be everything I wanted in a man and he had made  me believe that I was everything he wanted in a woman  we had shared pictures a lot of pictures so he new what I looked like and I new what he looked like  well this guy was just to good to be true just a wonderful man he would tell me he loved me and how he wanted a future with me. He decided that he had to come see me so after two weeks of talkin and getting to know eachother through conversation  he shows up on my door step at around 1 am on Saturday morning. I aswered the door and he was just as beautiful as his pictures but I could tell I wasn't everything he imagined id be. I still had a day and a half with this guy and I new he didn't like me the way he said he did because of the way I looked can you imagine the heartache of rejection when its slapped in your face?Well he ended up staying the whole time and we had a nice time  we took my girls to see a movie and he came to my mothers house for dinner and what not! We did sleep together but I feel like he did it out of pity for me. It just hurts to be rejected by someone who tells you they love you and how beautiful you are I told him how scared I was to meet him cause I didn't want to disappoint him but he said ""what do you think I'm a shallow person? I think your beautiful and I want to be with you"". So now here I am 2 days later not one phone call from him and a broken heart to deal with! ",0
  This is my first entry at blogger.com ever. I don't know what to say. Hi Nikole. ,0
"  So these two girls published an article in the school newspaper about the cliques in my school. It's a horrible article. Like  get shot in the head and die. In it they listed what cliques exist at my school--The Asians (it's funny they list that as the first one  because thats the 'clique' they belong to) the Brown kids  The Ghetto Group  The Cheerleaders/Jocks/Preps  the Punks  the Goths and the Druggies. Okay  what the hell? There are 3 kids at my school that could be labeled punk. Two of them are actually Punks  and one of them is a good friend of mine. The other one is a girl who used to be punk  but now she's all...not. This entire article is about how we shouldn't be labeling kids because HEY!  That's what causes cliques!  And then they go and categorize every student at the school? Assholes.  And then  they thought it would be nice to teach me about these cliques.  Students feel acceptance and approval when they are with their ""own people"". How does one come to be labeled as a part of one of these cliques? The way one speaks  dresses common interests and tracking levels.   Tracking levels? Okay! I have no idea what that means.    Students who can be categorized in more than one clique are considered ""confused"". For Example  we were listening to two studens in our class talk about a boy who likes to dress more urban but he listens to rock music at the same time. People were making fun of the boy behind his back saying he was ""confused"".  Cry me a fucking river.  The article goes on about stupid shit. Saying that the two most segregated clubs in my school are DECA and the Multicultural Club. Ironically  THEY'RE IN BOTH.  Oh  I don't want to join that club...It's so...Asian  What the hell. People use that as an excuse?  They ended it by saying that the only way to change this is to make a difference...within. Fucking Hippies.  On that note  all i have to say is...    We can dance if we want to  we can leave your friends behind  'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance  Well they're no friends of mine     Amen. ",0
  Someone's listening to WHAM! and whoever it is  rules.  I told Nora that I wanted to be an english teacher and she choked on her water. Hahaha. ,0

"  Been sg for so long  never been Esplanade... Finally  last night went there with my best friend. at first  i thought i will be deadly late then i sms her and told her that i might be late. who knows she just took the train right before me! so after she alight a while  i be there with her! feel like luckly...  then we planned to dine at foodcourt... walk walk walk... foodcourt seems disappear... so we asked the security guard. He told us that the foodcourt vanish since month ago... with no choice  we go McD  both ordered McWing... four tiny chicken and french fries and one cup of coke...  when we were Esplanade  it was already 8:30pm. The Nyoba Dance was showing... dont know wat they acting .. like typical japanese weird movie style.. Really feel like ""gui3 yi4"" There is one scene that the man with the fake horse walk straight. All of us thought it will stop before the edge... who knows it just walk walk walk and go through the audience. Those sitting audience quickly stand up and move away. For those standing of course just ""dan hoi""(canto) la  After the show  we watch New Asia performance. The Indian drummer really terro~~ He called as Kamar. The speed and his finger strength really incredible! I fancy the another modern drummer. Tama Goh dont know i spell it correct or not... later check out his detail...i mean i will try  He looks like so serious and when he play drum he kept looking at Kamar direction! I feel like he is challenge kamar when he played the drum as solo performance.  Really a nice trip... can meet up with my best friend. ",0

  Millionaire say Got a big shot deal And thrown it all away but But I'm not too sure How I'm supposed to feel Or what I'm supposed to say But I'm not  not sure  Not too sure how it feels To handle every day And I miss you love  Make room for the prey 'Cause I'm coming in With what I wanna say but It's gonna hurt And I love the pain A breeding ground for hate but...  I'm not  not sure  Not too sure how it feels To handle everyday Like the one that just past In the crowds of all the people  Remember today I've no respect for you And I miss you love And I miss use love  I love the way you love But I hate the way I'm supposed to love you back  It's just a fad Part of the teenage angst brigade and I'm not  not sure  Not too sure how it feels To handle everyday Like the one that just past In the crowds of all the people  Remember today I've no respect for you And I miss you love And I miss use love  Remember two days I've no respect for you And I miss you love And I miss use love  I love the way you love But I hate the way I'm supposed to love you back ,0

  Well I finally got around to trying out this blogger- even though I've had the google toobar for ages  *and* was a loyal googler long before that.  Silly me.  I first tried to blog with a different blogger site  and To Tell You The Truth  I didn't like the feel.  Oh  it was simple enough  if awkward  but the 'home' page of the blogging site was so darn busy I felt lost there.     This place is so much better. I should have gone with what I knew was a tried and true service.  Anyways  this is my dumping ground.  Stuff I find on the internet that I must squawk about (good and bad)  late night frustrations and nightmares  and the occasional proud parenting moment (or self flaggellation over same)-- all will be posted here so I can embarrass my family and bore strangers.  I hope you'll drop in occasionally. ,0
  They say when it rains it pours and boy are they right.  Things that have happend to me this month-- graduation  birthday  mother's day  breakdown of both vehicles at the worst possible time  frustrating treading of water re the fixing of the lawnmower  which means my grass is waist high now.  Then He Who Is Mine went and tore his bicep off the bone-- surgery to reattach it was just Thursday.  Now he's on a forced three month medical leave  crippled up and unable to do anything with his arm in a splint  *and* because his injury happened at home  he's not eligible for light duty at work  therefore he's out of luck on the paycheck department.  So.  I've put in my app in several places the last few days and told the boss to expect a phone call or three but please don't think I'm leaving (are you kidding? This job is manna from heaven).  I also spent the day (and half the night) futzing around with an old computer trying to get it ready so my MIL can use it at work. In the process  I have made it so that DH's compter... the one with EQ installed mind you... won't even boot.  I will have to spend a week futzing around with that one too to figure out why.  Plus I got a virus during all this nonsense.     I am bushed already  and I've got three months to go.  I just wish a magic genie would come clean my house and yard. ,0

  This is my first attempt at keeping any sort of journal. I have never been very good at keeping any sort of record of my life. I have always had the fear that once an experience is put on paper  the brain no longer has a need to remember it and the memory is thus discarded  or rerouted for use in another way. Therefore  I am rather skeptical to put much of note down here too soon. Perhaps my mind ramblings will be just that  ramblings  nothing more  nothing less. Or  perhaps  I will learn that the more I jot down  the more I will be able to remember. The brain never ceases to amaze me. It remembers things long since forgotten  in a way...Perhaps that is where DeJaVue comes from. I am constantly in a state of rememberance  that is the way that I know I am on the right track in life. Whenever I don't get a memory of something that I am doing that I know I have never done before  I know that what I am doing is that which I am supossed to be doing. My life  otherwise  might get very complicated and then where would I be?  A friend from my childhood has had a very trying life and started blogging to sort things out. I am very proud of her for that. She is who made me decide to try it. I don't really have an outlet for my life  my husband has a hard time understanding my need for higher and higher education. That is not to say that he is not supportive or encouraging by any means  it is just that he felt a Bachelors degree was all that was really needed. I  on the other hand  feel that I need to get more. I am in the process of completing my BA in Molecular Biology and a minor in Chemistry  only to persue a DVM/PhD combo in the next 6yrs.  Perhaps I will obtain that goal  but for now I am just looking forward to finally obtaining my first degree...and it has only me since 1996...3 years sabatical for work and my son...etc  basically life in general... Well  that is it for my first blog  perhaps next time it will be more insightful. ,0

  So alot of weird shit has been happening to me lately. For some reason  a reason which ill-ludes me  I can not seem to have a normal everyday boring relationship. There always seems to be some kind of drama or opstical. One of my more intelligent female friends seems to think it's because I don't choose the right kind of women  i should remind her that there aren't many women out in the world like her. Well if anyone has any tips on what is the right kind of women  I'm open to suggestions. Maybe it's that I just don't know what I want. I suppose when one thinks about it  my issues aren't that different then anyone elses but that doesn't help me feel like i'm not alone in this deal. I guess when it comes to these situations  in the end we are all really just alone in a crowd... ,0
  car shopping today went well. i'm really looking at two cars  the nissan spectra and the a saturn coupe. both have the basics that i want  sporty look  power everything  sunroof  standard transmission etc. the spectra has got more balls than the saturn but i think i'll get a better deal with the saturn. this is my first experiance buying a NEW car. soo many choices  i feel like a kid in a candy store..hehe  still no real resolution on the female issue. seems as though it get more complicated whichever way i go  so i think my plan is going to be to just ride out the storm and hope for a better days in the future. i know i know not a very creative solution but i honestly can't think of anything else.  on a different note i was thinking about the relationship my generation has with their work. my parents worked three jobs when they were younger and to this day i haven't know them to complain about it. they saw it as a chance to make money and as simply doing what you needed to do. it's strange that just one generation later we see people who can barely handle working one fulltime job and endlessly complain about how much they do. i really believe if we worked harder as a generation we would not only do better personally but do more for each other. not to get too religious but catholics believe that forgiveness/redemption is not based on faith alone but also on good deeds. maybe if we did more for each other on a regular basis we would all be better off  then again that's just my opinion... ,0
  Monday  31st May 2004       Haiz! This my blog and here  i shall fill you on with the events of my life starting from today. My life starts with a quite refreshed good night's sleep. Today was quite a disaster because i fell out with my bestest fren ever  Judy. I love her so much man. Haiz  luckily we patch up le or i really dunno how miserable i will be. Life has not be going on smoothly for me and i felt so miserable. I love all mi frens  mi family  mi everything but sometimes it gets on my nerves when people just dun understand you. Anyway  despite the disaster  i managed to be happy because of Francina. She is now one of my best frens. She is always there for me. Just some numbers  and there she is  on the other end of the line  giving me good advice and comforting me. Francina is really the only comfort i find in this new school. I felt happy  glad to be her friend and know that i can always trust in her. *sigh* Today  she is going off to Holland. Passed me some of her books that are due by Friday before she left and i gave her a feather for good luck. I shall miss her when she is gone...I really hope for a better day tomorrow man...haiz... ,0

  It was a good movie. You should go see it if you haven't already. It was really funny. Today was a pretty normal day. I had my cousins over the night before. We got up and ate breakfast and then basically didnt do anything. Micheal had to leave and play in the band fora  memorial service. So me and brent just hung out. It was pretty cool. We drove the gator and got really muddy. we then jumped on the trampoline. That was kinda cool. Then we took him home. I went to kohls then and then went to sams. I went home and slept for a while  then rode the gator  and got really muddy.. I then tooka shower and got ready to go out. Then I went and saw Shrek 2. It was really funny. They used some stuff from some older movies so some of the stuff some of the kids didnt understand. well thats all that happened today. i think im gonna go to bed. until next time. ,0
  School is finally out. I think that graduation went pretty well. I cant wait until high school. It is going to be so much fun with all of my friends and new teachers and etc. lol. It is sad to be leaving teh grade school and all our past teachers and jr high  but they have prepared us for bigger and better things and we are ready. so everyone enjoy your summer and make sure to rite comments to me.

  Today is Memorial day. If you see a veteran tell them thanks. Because if you think about it  withought them we would probably be under a rule of another country. And we wouldnt have the freedom that we take for granted in the U.S. So please if yous ee a veteran tell them thanks for all that they have done. It will make their day a little brighter. ,0
  Glad school is finally out. Have nothing to do but sit around and watch tv and be on the computer. I wished i lived in town cuz it is so much better cuz there is a lot  more stuff to do. I cant think what to rite in here but if u have any ideas gimme them and i will put them in. ,0
  Hey everyone this is my blogger. Its kind of like a personal profile but its better. So leave a message on it if you want. and have fun goign though the site. I just started it so there isnt much to look at.   Cya Matt ,0
  Last Sunday I completed my first long run  5 miles. Not bad. I followed the suggested training regimen this week  even the Friday cross-training session. My packet of training info suggested that pool running was  hands down the best cross-training activity for runners. I decided since I bought a swimsuit last fall  I would put it to good use at Yale's Olympic-sized pool.   The only person in the area who didn't think I was a complete idiot was the undergraduate student lifeguard  whom I informed of my intent to pool run. He was a member of the Yale swim team  and  very familiar with pool running. He proceeded to describe types of pool running exercises  and while trying to explain one in particular  asked me if I was familiar with water polo. I replied  No  but I know how to play Marco Polo. Unfortunately  my childhood days of Marco Polo training proved insufficient   Referring to pool running  the article states that   it looks a little odd. Well  they were right. All 15 or so people at the pool  including the children trying to play around in the lane next to me  thought I was a complete whack-job. To give you a better idea of what pool running looks like  think of a common dream you might have had or heard of - you know  the one where someone is chasing you and you're running but not going anywhere? It's like that  but add to your mental picture: 8 lanes of professional swimmers  1 lane of 3 kids trying not to stare  a swim cap  goggles  and Melissa Bourgeois trying to run to the other end of the pool without drowning. That's pool running.   Although I looked like a total ass in the pool  I felt great afterwards  much unlike I feel today. It seems I have either mild food poisoning or a stomach virus  either way  I can't even think of food without wanting to vomit. Suffice it to say I will not make my 6 mile long run today  which I am very disappointed about. It's only going to make my 7 miler next week that much harder. I'm trying to get as much rest as possible today so I can try to make up the long run tomorrow. We'll see. Right now I'm going to head for the couch and a little comedy central ,0
"  1st blog ever. I'm sure that by tomorrow I'll forget I even started this whole blog thing... Maybe not tho'.  We'll see.    Oh... what to talk about???  Umm... I dumped my boyfriend this weekend.  Now I have to move all my shit  including a piano  couch  entertainment center  etc.  out of his house.  That sucks.  He's a cool guy  but unfortunately  cannot be honest.  He has a serious lying problem.  I have given him  plenty  of chances and this weekend was the last straw.  Hopefully this will be a wake up call and he won't fuck up future relationships the same way.  Good luck to him.   Now I am at work.  I am a Customer Relations rep for a utility company.  Everyone that calls hates me.  Makes for a long day.   I had a horrible dream last night that the world was ending due to global warming and I had no choice but to die a slow and painful death.  Thank you ""Day After Tomorrow"" previews!  It was a great way to start a great day. :)    The upside is that today is TUESDAY!!!  Only 3 and a 1/2 more shitty days left 'til the weekend. YAY!!!!!  Ta ta. ",0
"  Okay... If i wrote about my situations w/my ex  i would have a huge fucking post  so I've decided not to write about boys at all. It's been FUCKIN' MADNESS!!!!   So.... um.....  uh.... let's see... It's FRIDAY!  Yay!!!!  This weekend is the Apalachin Fireman's Field Days.  Tonight i'll be taking my daughter to watch the fireworks.  Tomorrow i'll be taking her to my aunt's to watch the parade go up the street and go to the Field Days to ride rides and stuff.  That's exciting.   Yesterday i went to one of those Adult Bookstores all by myself!  How creepy.  It was like me and 10 hairy greasy icky men.  I bought a lovely blue ""personal massager"" w/a dolphin on it to give my clitoris the special attention that it deserves.  I took it up to the guy to pay for it and he was like ""I have to test it""  so of course  i giggled b/c i thought he was joking.  It turns out he was serious... i guess they have a ""no refund  no return"" policy (which makes sense)  so he had to take it out of the box and put batteries in it and make sure it worked AND IT DIDN'T!!!  So i had to go get another one!!!  It was very awkward  but the guy was really cool about it.    Other than that  i guess i have no news. Ta ta. ",0
  Hey how is everyone. Heather has moved here and we are doing really well. We  spent 17 hours in the car this past weekend going to my friend Jared's  wedding and we will be going to Jessica's wedding theis weekend. we haven't  killed each other so that is really impressive. I am a little tense about  the wedding but I guess that is good otherwise I would probably be terrible.  I guess I still might.  Heather is doing really well.  She has been handling the move well even though I know she misses her  friends back in Colorado.  I am considering taking a Youth Ministry position at Fellowship of the  Metroplex. It is a fairly large church wich I am not a big fan of but I am  praying over with Heather and we need your prayers to help us with the  decision. We are also considering some other options of ministry and would  appreciate your prayers. Thanks for everyone's help and support.  Jake ,0

  Heather and I have spent the last two weekends at weddings and over 27 hours in the car. Suprisingly we did not kill each other and got along fine.  It was a little nerve racking to perform Jessica' s wedding but it was an honor to do it. I just didn't want to screw up the day she would remember forever.      Heather is doing well since she has moved here. She has already found a job that I think she will enjoy. She is going through training right now so she is not really getting to do her actual thing yet. She is working at Church's Home for Children and will be working with kids around the 8-12 age.  She will do and excellent job.   We have officially started the wedding plans. This past Sunday we went to Guest Island Ranch in Ames to see if we could have our reception or rehearsal dinner there. It was pretty interesting especially with my overdramatic dad there.   We liked it a lot and to be honest there are not a large number of options.  So we will see on how it goes. Be praying that we can plan a fun wedding but one that is reasonable and cheap. Anyway it will be good to hear how everyone is doing.  Jake  Here is a pic of us in Germany ,0

  Hey ya'll! Today was MUCH better than yesterday! Well  I didn't let things get to me as much as I did yesterday! Anyway  its kinda funny. Well the other day  Monday I think  me and Ryan Larson were throwing a plastic bottle on the bus and I threw it at him and it went out the window instead cause I missed. the bus driver didn't turn it in till today  and I got called up to the office during first period. I dont care though  I only got a hour of ASD. Its my first time too so its not that big of a deal. But the thing that pisses me off is that Ryan didn't get ANYTHING! He was flicking me with a rubber band! Hmmm...well what else happened? I had the oral in spanish today  it was easy. After school Ashley came over. It was so funny  we were wired! She's the best friend ever! I can't wait till the weekend. I'm not sure what I'm doing on Friday night  but Saturday I haveta go to a cousins wedding in South Carolina. It'll be fun! Sunday is Ashleys birthday so hopefully we can hang out.    Well I hope ya'll had a good way too! Just think...6 more days left of school! YAY! I'm excited! Love ya'll! MWAH :-* ,0
  First Post Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Whats up I dont know what to say here  Um My name is Chris and I am 16 from the boring state of Minnesota I am into 90's grunge and current metal... not that really really heavy sh*t but it is heavy enough you know? I go to school in Chaska... people there are really weird  Oh yah I am in 11th grade right now 2 lets just say I geuss...

"  If you want my life you can have it...   Hey everyone its Chris Here once again... I haven't written in this a lot  but here it is. Um Well I am not going out with Victoria anymore  and a lot has happend. Well I am out of school finally and I am not grounded. I feel really happy right now... I feel important.. Never really felt that way before. My new girlfriend Georgia has made me really happy inside  ya know? She makes me feel like I actually am important and thats a great feeling. My ex-girlfriend got really mad cause I was friends with girls  and cheated on me. Eh it was really dumb  and it was a friend of mine. And then she dumped me and said I could go out with anyone I would want  so I went out with Georgia. It felt like 9 months went down the drain and all that stuff. But finally yesturday she said she was sorry and ""demanded"" me to take her back. I told her I didn't wanna deal with it and move on with my own life  but I would like to be a good friend still. She got really angry and hung up the phone. Today She called me back and said she was sorry  then I told her I respect everything she says and all of her desicions. Since we broke up though I didnt really like the fact that she was trying to get me jealous by saying she is a whore by doing stuff with about literally 8 guys and going out with another... the same guy she cheated on me with. Its cool though We all take bumpy rides on the coaster of life  but we will come back. What one said before... What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger. I have become more self-dependant.. I feel more happy about it also and shit wont put me down as much... Other then that  The new Slipknot CD is awesome. ",0

  There are things running through my head today.  What should I do about my future.  I have a decent job  an apartment  a relationship  but  what do I want to do with my life?   There are many things I've wanted to do.  When I was in high school I wanted to be a broadcaster.  When I was in college  while things became less clear  I knew that I wanted to study English and Tudor history and combine them somehow or another.  Now that I'm out of school  all I want is to go back - to do something different; to be something more than what I am.    So  here are some things I've thought about doing.  I haven't really thought them through all the way  but that's what this sort of forum is for  right?    I've always wanted to write books.  Either researching stuff from the Elizabethan or early Tudor time period  or historical based romances or even just plain old fiction.  The problem is - what would I write about?  There are already tons of books about Elizabeth I  her sister Mary  her cousin Mary Stuart...it's a bit frustrating.  But  I suppose there's always room for a well researched  well written book out there.    I've thought about studying to become a teacher.  But  what would I teach?  English or History?  On what level would I teach?  I'm not the most patient person in the world...I'd hate teaching in an elementary school or even a middle school.  So  I guess that leaves high school and college levels.  I'd enjoy having the summers off  but probably not much else.  I'd love to be able to travel for 3 months out of every year.  Or even travel for 1 month and work the other 2 doing something else.  It's a possibility I guess I should look into.    The law has also fascinated me from a young age.  I'd love to be a lawyer.  I should look into law schools  at least to find out the requirements.    All in all  I think what I'm doing now is good for me - it's making me question what I   should  be doing and what I  could  be doing.  That's never a bad thing  is it? ,0
"  HEY WHATSUP...i doubt anyone will ever ever read this...least on a regular basis...but who does? ya i just needed a place to put everything down on paper...or w/e this stuff is made out of... and also i made this for all those boring days in the summer where this just might cross your mind and then u can read it...so if u read it then awesome  this is just mostly me talking to whoever wants to hear aight...aight......so ya comment if u have any other enlightening comments u wanna make or if u just wanna make fun of me...Thanks...i appreciate it...o YA Jenilee thanks with the hard thought naming process...        So i guess ill start this whole thing by telling a funny story...ya it happened i guess 3 days ago and anyways i was at this grad. party @ the duffies and well it was pouring down rain of course and everyone and their cat was there. So i had to go and park half a mile down the road  and run to their house in the flood...and ya i know im dumb but i wore those really cheap old navy sandals and well lemme tell ya... you cant run in themm...especailly if theyre wet...ya basically im saying that i fell on the way there but i eventually got there and it was packed out... but the food was good and the people were cool so i had fun for the most part until i discovered the chips and hot sauce...IT WAS SOOO good...i loved it..it just set ur mouth on FIYYYAA  but not too much and ya it was goodddd. So you would probably think thats a good thing but i was chilln upSTAIRS and so i'd have to go up n down em to get more...well so i run outta chips and so i get up to go down for more and im headin down the stairs and i catch glance of this amazingly hott girl(not sayin who) and well i guess i lost focus for a second cuz my hand with the plate of hot sauce hit the side rail and i missd a step and ya the plate toppled all over the white carpeted stairs... and all over mrs. stark who was sitting on them for some reason?? so ya it was embarrasing...especially asking mrs duffie for something to clean it up with... mrs stark wasnt mad..PHEW and it ended up bein alrite besides the embarrassment...so basically the moral of the story is Never NEVER eat the hot sauce at those so called ""GRAD PARTIES"". just don't...its not worth the risk...the RUSH is only for a second...but the consequences they never go away...so DONT...Do...GRAD Hot SAuce...       THE MORE YOU KNOW... ",0
  Ok  so I went to bed at 4.48 a.m. Yes  very late. But it's not my fault! The medicine makes me sleep earlier and then I wake up and voila  its that time. So I didn't go to school all week. Oh well  and I should be studying for exams  but if I sit in a chair  I just feel like fainting. Oh  and my mother is a bitch. My computer isn't working and she refuses to call Dell up to fix the problem! Ugh!  Meanwhile  when I EVENTUALLY fall asleep  all I can dream about is my damn Biology exam. Maybe it's telling me that I should actually study. WHO KNOWS!? ,0
"  Alright  this is my first Blog post. So  I guess i'll write about what happened today. Well  just like the res of this week  I went to sleep at 4a.m. thanks to my damn headaches. So  I missed school  again. I supposed it can't be helped with all my damn problems  and the operation I had last week but anyway.   I got exams next week! Not good  I only started studying an hour ago  and the exam's on Monday. Of course  i've always been one to procrastinate with my work and studying  it's just that now I have an excuse as to why i'm going to fail! Sigh!   This weirdo called ""Yen-Po"" wants to come to my house. He's this weird homosexual with alot of issues. I'm not sure I want to see him because he said he ""wants to see me"" which conjures up some pretty vivid images in my sick little mind.   I had a really weird dream last night. I was at the cinema  eating popcorn. Out of no where i'm sleeping in a bed with some weirdo and they are holding a cane. At that point I woke up  and then when I went back to sleep I had rather enjoyable dreams about my school  and how I was causing it mass destruction. Ahh  the joys of an unconcious mind.  Well  this is it for my first post  i'll be back later - Kalinixta. ",0
  Ok  it's the weekend before my first exam! Biology...hmm I did 6 hours of study today  3 practice exams  and I still have to learn the theory more thoroughly! Stupid viruses...meanwhile  i'm waiting for my mum to bring the pizza home  so toodles! ,0
  I just slept 4 hours. Maybe it's just the airconditioning unit  or it's just that I'm not at home. Well  you know I'm not at home right now. I'm somewhere else and I'm not used to sleeping at somebody else's house. ,0
  This is my first post and I don't know what to put here. I'm just making a blog in the hope that google would give me a gmail account so that I can change the email I used in yahoo with that of google because of the immense storage capacity. ,0
  If you wanna let your heat out  then go to one of the moviehouses at Quiapo and definitely someone will sit beside you and ask you if you want sex. Believe me  it happened to me last week and whoah! I was invited instantly to go outside the moviehouse and go somewhere private. I won't go through the details of what happened but I'm telling you it was hot! ,0
  I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you -Hoobastank ,0
  Right now  I'm in a room with someone. A very goodlooking guy with a nice body to match his face. He's sleeping and I can't do anything about it. Oh well  that's life. ,0
  This is my first time use this blogging actually dont really like it. But since i really need to throw some feelings somewhere..  so i think this would be the best place. Tres bien... ,0
  Today i got my streamyx done. So happy about it and i've been downloading mp3s since i came back from work hehe... Ergh but kinda sad because all my cdrom are with my bf. I want to install ragnarok malay version at my pc. Oh well   i just have to wait for him to send it over... Still can't forget him..  tho kodok have make my feelings towards HH fading.. hmm but i hate to know that so many girls call up my bf even tho when we're dating. They really have no manners.. MF !! I think si kodok also layan them all if not how come they want to call him? Erghh when i think of all that  i feel like i wanna clash. But erm.. like i said.. what i am now..  preventing me to go much further or making any quick decision. Even when it comes to HH  i'm restricted..  i can't go much further.. to know him or whatsoever. But deep down inside... i really really want to see him again and again..Err adios ! ,0
"  ""It's hard for me to say it"" thats what he said to me... Darn..what have i done? I shouldn't bring up the matters..but this stupid mouth just slip it out. He sacrifice it for the sake of my relationship. Though i don't know what's in his mind..exactly. I'm gonna miss him.. big time !!I don't know whether he really wants it or just play a around.. Gosh.. can i lie to myself?   I'm so tired being here..  Suppressed by all my childish fear... And if u have to leave..  I wish that u cud just leave.. Cause your presence still lingers here... And it wont leave me alone..  These wounds wont seem to heal This pain is just too real.. There's just so much that time cannot erase.. When you'd cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all your fears.. i've held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me..  You used to captivate me by  your resonating light  but now i'm bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me...  i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone.. and though you're still with me.. i've been alone all along ....................... :""( ",0

  I awoke this morning in a foul mood.  Why??  I don't really know.  I had become a little testy on the phone with my girlfriend last night but not enough to justify it carrying over to the next day.  One thing I do know is it is setting the precedence for the rest of the day  which isn't really surprising as once I get in a foul mood it is extremely hard to pull myself up out of the trenches of self loathing and hatred.  I've been at work for the last 4 hours and have thus far accomplished nothing  at least a lot more nothing then what I usually accomplish while at work.  In recent times I have slipped from a model employee to the try to do as little as possible disgruntle employee  reason being my boss recently hired a new employee and our office is turning into a good ole boys club where I being of the opposite sex feel out of place.  I work at a university and have worked in the same department for the past four years  my official job title is Computer Support Assistant yet my responsibilities have grown much since I started gainful employment here.  Yet now Im feeling under appreciated as the new guy is getting paid more than me and is perhaps destined  in the near future  for a pay rise  just to stick the knife in a little deeper.    You could argue that his job title carries more clout then mine as he is officially known as a Web Developer  yet I as a lowly old Computer Support Assistant should technically be paid less  yet it appears that I have moved from the illustrious realm of shit kicker to web developer over the years  yet I still kick the shit when ever someone is in.  Technically we should be on an equal playing field  yet this too doesnt seem to be the case.  Because I have been here the longest I am given the added responsibility of maintaining our servers while my boss lays on a beach somewhere smelling of coconut oil and slowly burning flesh.   But alas it is not to be  I must suffer in silence  I know Ive not been very silent.  I do however feel much better now after this little venture  perhaps my foul mood was simply due to pent up frustrations which have since subsided as a result of this writing.  I feel better now and perhaps well enough to do some real work. ,0

"  so yesterday I was going though my old bookmarks and then I found the one that was my boyfiends  from right before we met till a short time after (a few days) then he said he removed it since he never had time to post and it was all about his ex anyway... so I clicked the little book mark and what do i see but a bunch of horable things about me  and i admit i am a bitch but  i have been really great as far as moods and that shit latly  so whats the deal right? the past few months i have been cooking  at least two dinners a night  do laundry for 7  some dishes ( he does seem to help with that on and off) then i get to fold and find a place for all the laundry  hope like hell i get time to eat dinner  and go to bed way to late  and get up way to early to start the day with most the time all 5 kids fighting  not getting ready  and still trying to get everyone out the door before 7:30. We drop off a few kids here and a few there  then i go to work for 5-8 hours  doing what? you might ask  well *fucking housekeeping*** what fun RIGHT? So everyday this is my day  and sometimes i have to go to the store and pick up more food for a bunch of ppl that dont care if i cook i guess cuz they dont always (rather  hardly ever) eat what i make.  So what i mean by two faced  i mean why would i do all this for more then me and my own kids if i didnt think he loved me  i thought so  untill i read what i read  and that isnt the first time he has been known to talk all that shit about me   so what am i doing I ask... self what the hell are you doing  this is looking like a realationship of convienence and not of love  or even lust or any of the good stuff. at least that is how i am starting to get the feelings from him  im just here  ruining his life for him  everything is my fault  geting old friends it really is. AND thats all i have to say about that....  on a lighter side  my youngest offspring  cut all her hair off on her own last night  she said she was ""fixing her bangs""  guess she was going for that bangs all around look...

"  So how many blogs do I have now? Let's count...probably 4  and I usually only use one which is Dead Journal. But hey  I want a new taste...so I'm gonna use blogger again. For the 3rd time? lol   It was (still is) very windy today. I like this cool breeze...although it was really hot today.   The moment I got up today I knew I was going to have a good day  cuz I woke up briskly and eager to go to Saturday School. But now that I think about it...today was a REALLY tiring day. The most tiring day I've ever had at Saturday School maybe. I mean HAL!! Hal is SO GODDAMN loquacious! (Hahah  there goes my vocab again...) He would NOT shut up!! We did show and tell again and he would make either a sarcastic remark or a ""Oh I have that"" to everything everyone says. YOU SMARTASS!! And then for HIS show and tell  guess what he gets out... fossils and anmonites.  He even made this presentation-board type of thing. And he talks back to me  says mean things that he doesn't mean  etc...that kid absolutely drives me  mad.  But what the hell  at least he's somewhat entertaining...half the laughter in that class is caused by Hal's smartness (and stupidness...today he said 'Stupidity counts in everything.' Daresama yanen...lol) . Talked to Victor today  was nice...he's so cute  hehe. It's so weird how my heart jumps whenever I see him. But his hideous sense of BAGS and HATS are disturbing...lol I guess he likes that military color combination...  Yusuke  Hiroaki  and I were gonna go to a movie tonight but since we found out it ends at 9:05  we cancelled it...plus we might not have gotten tickets  we were planning to see  Day After Tomorrow . That comes out today! So then we planned to go out to dinner  but since I finish work at 5 we postponed that as well. lol   Apparently I might be going to prom with Hiroaki...? Yusuke and Jyongri persuaded him to go with me  and it might just happen! It all depends on if he has the whole outfit though  I hope he does. Well whatever  I'm not too concerned with going dateless after all. As long as we all have a good time...  Speaking of packing  I leave in  15 days!!!  Do you read that Courtney  I'LL BE IN THE SAME GODDAMN COUNTRY IN 15 DAYS! I'll be sure to give you a call when I get to Indiana kk? ;) Ahhhh I'm so excited...XD XD   I must go do homework now. Adios amigos. ",0

  This is the product of idle time. Usually phone support during queue time does not give us this much idle time  that is until you are one of two who have a direct customer service split. Then you get to sit around and do nothing but wait for one of two tiny lights to come on for you to answer the phone. Lucky for me this phenomenon does not happen very often on weekends. Therefore I am left here contemplating the future  browsing for new platform games  twiddling my thumbs  and feeling a little guilty because the rest of my team is busy taking calls. Not that I really mind the rest  but you kind of wish everybody else was resting with you. Right now I really wish I were home already inflicting pain upon my thumb by pushing on a little analog stick on my PS 2 but then again I come in and work all night so I can pay for my little electronic addiction. Of course I think I'm rambling now because I really just don't have that much to do  so if this were a piece in English class I would probably flunk because of the lack of coherence in this post. Then again since its not then I think I'll ramble on  that is if I get to think of anything more to ramble about. Hmmm  the light came on interrupting my train of thought  but I'm back now. Now I'm wondering how I'm going to fund my CD habit. I really want to get my own copies of so many discs now I think I'm going to drive myself crazy thinking about where all my money went. After I get my credit card bill gets to me that is  but then again at least CD's are tangible and they happen to be mine. I think this is enough rambling for this first foray into the world of blogs lets just see what happens next. ,0
  Well another day is about to go by. 3 calls down and not really sure how many more to go...life in the fast lane. ,0

  SUMMER SUCKS!  I know  I know...*my* opinion. My computer's not working right  so I can't use my MSN messenger and Yahoo barely works. Therefore  I haven't been able to talk to the majority of my friends this summer. Phones are always busy or they're not home. Or  like my best friend  Jimmy  too busy with his girlfriend to talk to me... Not to mention that I've been working alot lately. I got my permit last Friday  so I've been driving alot lately  lol  which is fun  damn near gave my mom a heart attack on several occasions. LOL. Well  I'll post again later. ,0
  I GOTTED GUINEA PIGGIES TODAY!! THEY'RE SOOOOO CUTE! I named mine Charlie amd my brother  Kevin  also got one  and he named his Junior. They're adorable!!! I went to our city's Relay for Life event thingy yesterday and into this morning. We had a group of 8 planned to get together and hang out there and raise money for cancer but  that's where the problem was...RELYING ON PEOPLE! Our team captain and another member were in Europe for out school's Orchestra class  2 people came...and left without letting anyone know  1 person came  but had to leave early cause she had to work  which was perfectly understandable. So  that left 3 of us...me  Kendra  and Lucas (I know names mean nothing to those of you that don't know me but  get over it). It was from 6 p.m. last night til 8 a.m. this morning  so we stayed up all night walking our school's track  where it was held. We had alot of fun! I hijacked Luc's hat too...I tend to do things like that when I get bored...LOL. Well  anyway  I'm gonna go...I have work tonight. :'( Byyyyyye!!! ,0

  Hello. I'm so glad you've come. Would you like a cup of tea? I like mine with two heaped spoons of sugar and full-cream milk. But you can have yours any way you like. I'm not going to stop you.   Well  I might as well introduce myself  since you've made it this far. And you look like you're comfortable so I've got nothing to lose.    My name is Mrs Walker and I am 26 years old. I live in a pink square house on Harlem Avenue  in a working class neighborhood ten miles west of the Chicago loop. My husband  Mr. Walker  and I  bought the house in April and we moved in on May 1.   Our house is different from other houses. From Harlem Avenue  our house looks just like a pink square lego brick that's come alive and has grown eyes and a mouth. In front of the house is a strawberry field and there are five fruit trees on our double lot. We have grape vines growing over the deck and peonies  roses and other exotic looking flowers exploding all over our Chicago plot. On the other half of the lot (it's a double) are neat blocks of soil divided by wooden walkways. We have planted corn  brocolli  carrots  beans  tomatoes  peppers and herbs here. Every day my husband and I look on in astonishment as the plants rise up out of the ground in their mission to feed us.   When we first looked at the house in March this year  we had no idea what was already in the ground. The stawberry plants  berries and grapevines have all burst forth since we moved in. In the last two weeks we have picked perhaps half a dozen pounds of strawberries. We've given away baskets to friends and I took a couple quarts into the office one day. We've made strawberry jam and I tried strawberry fudge but I didn't wait for the mixture to get hot enough and it didn't set. I threw the whole pan of fudge out and only had to feel guilty about the dollar or so that I spent on the can of evaporated milk  and the three cups of sugar.   Well  that is not exactly true. I was sorely devastated by my failed fudge attempt and I bought new ingredients at the grocery store today. In fact I'm going to attempt a new batch again right now. If it turns out alright this time  I'll share the recipe with you.   So please come back to visit. Next time I may even have a chocolate biscuit for you to eat with your tea. ,0
  While I was reading other friends' blogs that I realized to just be myself... I really don't think I've ever done that before  not in the 14-almost 15- years that I've been alive.  It's hard to imagine  I know  but it's true!  Zac's writing awakened me... he showed me  not trying to  how to be myself.  So here it goes:  I like a guy  named Eric and supposebly he likes me back the same way-according to Erin.  I just hope he didn't lie and was telling the truth... I've been hurt and I don't want to be hurt again.  I'll post tomorrow. ~Paranoia ,0
  Hell! I'll come up with something to say sooner or later  probably later! ,0
  Well I talked to Eric and he said he didn't tell Erin anything  but he does like me.  So that's good.  Although  he just wants to be 'single' for awhile.  Oh well.. we're still friends  and that's awesome!  I was just starting to come out of my head  but I thnik I'm gonna go back in for awhile....  ~Can't blame a girl for trying... ,0
  I'm soooo glad i'm not an 8th grader anymore! lol I'm gonna do a lot of things this summer... the first thing i'll probably do is go to the Queen of all Saints' Fest soon.

  Yes my first entry! I really like to do this a long time ago when I found out to one of my friends this blogspot thing.... Its cool!! No need to write... If you guys don't know yet  one of my past time is writing to my diary  I have 3 notebooks filled with stuff regarding my life and it is nice to share whats going on with my life to my friends. I hope you can visit this page everytime. Just to let you know who I really am  and what kind of person I am (its the same thing right!) haha... So everyday I will write my high time and low time... Right now my HIGH TIME: Singing again! Its been a long time  I love to sing and Im going to look for a way to join the choir again. That is my passion  but do not ask me to sing in public because it's not my thing to memorize lyrics of the song  but if you will request beforehand I can sing it for you... I also sing in weddings and funerals (joke!)  so if you guys need a wedding singer just give me a ring! DOWN TIME: I wasn't able to sleep well I do not know why    maybe because there is a lot of things going on with my mind  my work  friends and family... work because I don't know yet if I will resign or not.... it's a question and you know how hard it is to look for a high paying job so I'm still thinking it over and over and over again!!! I just hope I will find an answer this week... Friends yes I love all my friends but I miss some of them specially my PREX family  we don't have time to bond anymore because of my schedule  I really miss them and I will try to make it up to you guys! My family  yes because there is a lot of things I want to do with our house I want to buy things  but of course I need money to buy it     maybe one by one I can buy things for them... specially T.V. I want to buy my mom a TV for her room so that she will be able to watch even if she is in her room.... Anyway Im sleepy now so till next time I hope I will have time tom. To write ,0

  Dear Friendship Troubles      Give your friend the weekend to calm down  and you should too. Think of what you might have said wrong to her. On Monday  try and talk to her again. Don't talk to her and bother too much. If she tells you to leave her alone  leave her alone. But just say to her  I understand that you are mad at me  but I really think you should listen to what I have to say. Then  if she lets you  explian to her that you are sorry  and you don't like not talking to her. If she doesn't let you explain  resort to the next step. Write her a note. Write down everything you would say to her if you were talking face to face. Tell her to write back  or talk to you. It might just take one appology  but if it doesn't don't keep bothering her. If she doesn't talk to you for more than a month  maybe this friendship wasn't meant to be. If you have any more problems  don't be afraid to tell me about them. ,0

  Hey Levi thanks for helping me figure this whole thing out  mad props bud!   This is how I feel You don't know me  so dont talk about me! I know what happened  I was there and you weren't! He is saying that I keep calling and bugging him  but I'm not. You didn't here the things that he said to me and you don't know the way he made me feel. He was my good friend  He could tell me anything  problems with his girlfriend or school  I could also tell him anything  I thought that I could trust him. I was wrong. He told you lies so that way he could be cool and I would be a fool. So this is how I feel. Right now I'm not thinking about what we could have had  Because you are not worth it. Why would I want someone who tells lies? Why would I want someone that can't respect me? You might ask why I am saying all of this if I think your not worth it  But the truth is I don't know either   I guess that's just how I feel! -Chelsea ,0
  Church was so much fun last night especially when we had the banana and orange eating contest.  You might be asking why it was so much fun  well the reason why is because you could only use one hand to eat both of them and I beat 4 other people!   Levi  Jessi  Joni  AJ  and everyone else knows how fun that was.  After church I went to one of bestest friends house  we ended up staying up until like 5 in the morning!  We ate Burger King for dinner and had Taco Bell at like 2am.  When we got to the window at Taco Bell we could not stop laughing  I wonder if the guy thought we were high (Levi knows what I'm like at 2am lol).  That's about all that we did.   Hey Sarah!  It was so good to see you at church  since I haven't seen you your graduation party.  Next time that I talk to you I will tell you who the peom is about.   Sorry that I don't have any more wonderful writings for you  Sarah and Levi  but I will try and write something later  so that way you will really know how I feel!  Love ya! ~Chel'C ,0
  This is my new blog.. i have closed my old one due to personal reasons... but never mind about the past.. the last few weeks was hell for me.. i lost my best friend to my enemy   i screwed up my client's case  my clients are still haunted by the lawyers to pay her legal fees  i spent my entire week trying to please my big client for documents  karen left me for japan  boyfriend was bus at work  bad mood  dint do as well last quater ...I am dying for a get away!....This week is better... i went JB shopping with yann... went dinner with karen last nite... missed her quite badly while she was at japan... We had our usual dinner at bishan..Junction8 is a dangerous place.. with charles and keith and their ever changing new collections  g2000 with their storewide sale.... and new players like seiyu.. which comes with loads of in house brands .. i saw this black shift dress.. so nice... only 33 leh.. even karen told me to buy it.. NO NO.. karen is a bad influence..heh.. i saved her from buying a cutie shoe from charles and keith.. i guess karen and i gonna be soul mates for a long time.. i lost my best friend and her best friend is at australia. so we can take care of each other untill clara returns.. and i got to return her to clara... actually i am glad that i lost pris at this time  she is seeing someone she likes  whom i disapproved as 'he' is not a christian  and i tink that they will not be happy together.. pris is always haunted by the bag idea that she shouldnt be going out with non christian... at least she has someone to hang on to if she is really depressed... and she has that group of girls to cheer her up... i feel that maby pris thinks that i am very shallow to give up our friendship.. but i have went alot to make a decision like this... i came a conclusion that i went through all her unhappy moments with her  and she shared her weekend with another group of people... many of her words sided them.. i decided.. that this friendship had to go... hiya... i hope i can get over this fast... ok.. better not talk too much about unhappy stuff.. its friday!... better finish up with my work so i can meet my darling tonight!!! ,0
"  let the anonymity begin.  i think we all have something we want to talk about  but that we can't quite bring ourselves to reveal to anyone we actually have to see face to face. i have an overwhelming feeling (regardless of its veracity) that no one will quite understand what i'm saying. but if you do  please share any insights you have with me. my views are not extreme or disturbing  just a challenge for me.  let's start with the introductions. i'm a 27-year old single female. this is NOT a solicitation for men to start asking me out. it's simply a fact. i love being single and being able to do whatever i desire with my life. i've recently returned to grad school and changed my career/life path extraordinarly. i've also moved to a new city where i have made some great friends (mostly male  as is the norm for me). i come from a christian household and still cling to my faith despite doubts and challenges. the big challenge currently is sex.  for better or for worse  i have a sex drive. currently  it's driving me mad. but i also have a moral code that keeps me from even entertaining the idea of casual sex. due to my odd combination of faith and life interests (drinking  smoking  crude jokes  liberal hippie crap  independent lifestyle  tolerance  tattoos  piercings  etc.) it is very difficult to find anyone who is compatable with me. and that's the beginning of the trouble...when i do someone who looks good on paper  i cannot get interested (even though i desparately need to release some pent-up sexual energy). i'm not looking for a solution  per se  but i am frustrated and venting. what am i looking for? HOPE.  so if you got it  send it my way. are you a christian man or woman who has found a great sexual and life partner despite not ""appearing"" to be the christian norm? i often consider giving in to a casual encounter  but i honestly don't think i could physically go through with it...and i'd certainly beat myself up afterward. not out of guilt  necessarily  but just cuz i know that's not what makes me happy.  life is good in so many ways  and hopefully through more of the posts i can open up more of who I am to myself (and to anyone who cares to read them). i am a very odd combination. and i like it :) but i think most people find me very confusing (probably think i'm a prude)...and they like it from about 10 feet away. goodnight moon.

  My Retirement  So now these are my retirement years No easy chair for me So many places I want to go So many places to see. For oh so long I was your friend  a colleague and now a new wife But now I am at a new beginning Starting a brand new life. That pile of knitting that patiently waited For me to take some time I might get back to you in a day Or put you back in line. Those cookbooks that pile higher and higher I hear their pleading call Beckoning for me to come and see them Before I see next fall. The vacations I will sit and plan Exotic places afar Traveling by train or bus Or even  in my trusty car. The whole world waits for me to start To claim it as its own The excitement overwhelms me at times From me I am sure this is shown. I wont forget the things I learned The people I have met Nor forget that first moment I will get my retirement check. No more alarms to waken me From my comfy rest I am retired now you see This new life is the best. Oh Retirement  sweet Retirement I sing with joy and praise The only damper to my joy I will miss my yearly raise!!!!! ,0
  The Meadow  These meadows I walk so fine and green Give my soul peace My mind is at ease I hear the river calling Tears flowing with my past I listen to them calling I am Home at last For so long I listened to the melody The calling The whispers They always haunted me I ease into some comfort As I stroll this grassy plain I take my final place Knowing the peace will surround me Will ease my troubles and pain I listen to your sorrow The tears you shed for me The asking of why this all happened But maybe in time you will see No more suffering or torment controls me I feel free and alert I am let go of what haunts me Please let go of your hurt Dont shed a tear Dont cry over me Dont feel like you failed I am at peace now you see My love for you did not go It will always be there In memories we had In the things that we shared I go away now To ease my tangled mind You will forever be My only one kind ,0
"  it's really sad when God takes away a life... especially when it's someone close to you.. especially when it's too soon.. like you wish that you could've spent more time with that person. you never realized how much they meant to you until they're gone. i guess it's part of life  to teach us how precious life is and how we shouldn't take it for granted. just came back from krish's cremation.. krish was this guy in my grade... never knew him well  since i only met him this year  but he was the first guy to talk to me at ASB. i still remember the first day  on the bus  he was like  ""hi!.. you're in 10th grade too?.. i'm a new student..."" and after that simple gesture  we started talking... when we arrived at school we didn't know where to go  so he was all  ""let's just go together... :)"" and after we found our own groups of friends  we sort of drifted awei... i regret it though.. i wish i could've learned more about him rather than shun him away. i never even knew the little details about him  like about his family or his past... i guess i learned that we shouldnt take anyone for granted.. coz tomorrow they might be gone just like that. the cremation was held in this Wat in Soi Ekkamai.. i've never been in a thai-style funeral  but it was pretty much the same... almost everyone at ASB was there.. not to mention all his old friends in NIST  RIS  ISB... there were about 500 + people!!!... and almost everyone was crying (including me.. hehe!)!... it just goes to show how much he touched everyone's lives in different levels... when they cremated him  they put inside his possessions  like a soccer ball and his favorite shoes  his cell and some cards and letters we made... and then they played ""i'll be missing you"" by p.diddy and faith evans... :( i'm gonna be thinkin of him every time i hear that song!!!  RIP Prishant Johri (Krish) December 25  1986-February 13  2004 Born on the 25th of December  the day of our Lord. Died on Friday the 13th  the day of bad luck. Mourned on the 14th of February  the day of hearts. Rest in Peace forever  Krish  you will be greatly missed. ",0
"  I used to eat strawberry chapstick when I was a kid. When I say eat  I'm talking roll up the tube and take bites of it. I also used to have tragically chapped lips. I would always ask my dad for a new tube when we were in the checkout line of the grocery store and he kept buying them until he realized that no human can go through chapstick that quickly if you use it in the conventional way. Perhaps the fact that my lips could have been used as an alternative to sand paper gave it away and he soon found out about my snacking habits and refused to buy me anymore chapstick.  Now many years later  I have a slight obsession with chapstick and other lip products and if I may say so myself  I also have wonderfully soft lips. But  I have recently concluded that the ingestion of strawberry chapstick has lead to my many neuroses (we'll get into them a little later). I suppose they could have come from my parents divorce  my mom's abusive remarriage  the teasing I endured at school  some chemical imbalance or maybe even the time I crashed my tricycle and whacked my head on the concrete  but I've decided I like blaming it on chapstick instead.  It wasnt until a few years ago that I realized I really did have some strange neuroses and that most other people have very few or even none. In the last few months  I've noticed that they effect me more that I ever thought. I used to think ""oh thats just a quirk about me"" or ""hey  everyone is a little crazy about some things"".  I am not a lunatic by any means and most of my ""quirks"" are internal and really only effect me  but because I know I was not ALWAYS this way  it has really lead me to wonder *When does a person become who they are going to be and when is it too late to go back?*  Of course you can get some therapy or take some medication to rid you of many issues you may have  but after you have grown and matured enough to even realize you have issues then wouldnt any kind of ""intervention"" change WHO YOU are or force you to go through live pretending that you are someone else after you have been ""cured""? Is a ""cure"" really just self-denial about who you really are? Do you really want to do that? ",0
  Question.   What is this blog about? why's it here? who the hell are you? and why do you think that this deserves to take up valuable internet real estate?   well i'll tell you grasshopper. this blog is a test  a personal test. a test designed to push my own boundaries  and maybe...just maybe bring into being something bigger than just another shitty internet blog.  ultimately  this blog will be a place where i can give wings to my voice and throw open the doors that hold back the whirlwind of emotions and thoughts that dance their way through my headspace. ambiguous enough for you?  on a specific note  i am hoping to eventually provide enough detail about my personality and ideas/ideals that at some point in the future my posts can be used to create a simulacrum of myself. some sort of personality that will capture the essence of what I am about. but that's more of a long term goal.  short term this blog will aim to provide myself with a sounding board for my own thoughts and emotions. a place where I can cry out to my imagined readers and tweak my opinions.  the title of the blog 'generation gap' reflects a deep emotional feeling that I have regarding being labeled by society  and falling down into the generation gap [or generation trap]. hopefully my rantings will address this give the site a 'feel' of changing for the better.  so who the hell am i? i am me! i am someone who is searching. someone who is constantly looking  not sure what he will find  but making the most of the journey of discovery. i am someone who is sick to death of the crap passed down to us by society  in an unconscious attempt to mold us and tell us how to be. i am someone who is trying to push my own boundaries to discover my own mettle and shine in whatever way i can. i am me.  as for why this site should exist  well simply put  cause i want it to. it represents an extention of my will into an infinate void [the interent] where there exists plenty of room for everyone to play. so if you run into this site and don't like it... don't read it  don't come back... sorted. this site exists for me  but if someone else benefits from it then fantastic!  next question. ,0
  Hey all.  I know i haven't been online for ages  and i'm probably a little slow on the uptake of things  but now it's time to catch up.  If i hurt you with what i say then that's too bad. Enjoy.  Let's start with: me. Surprise  surprise. i'm human. i'm not infallible. i know i can be a jerk. and believe me  i hate myself more than anyone ever will. Pst Mike's service has impacted many people  and i'm no exception. On our own we are nothing. God makes us who we are.  Next: Adam. Don't be ignorant. make everything you do deliberate  and assume responsibility if you've done wrong.  Timothy Wan. If at first you don't succeed  try again. even God can't please everyone. patience is the mother of virtue.  Brendan. Very glad you're learning stuff. whatever it is  it's time to grow up. don't take offence so easily. be proud of what God has made you  and use it as your edge.  You can't control the wind  but you can adjust your sail.   Juliana. If you can't say anything good  then it's probably not worth saying. don't be ignorant; you're not stupid. things only make you angry when you remember them. the best revenge is to  forget .  If i'm wrong about something  feel free to call to hurl obscenities at me. oh look  my sense of humour is back. ,0
"  Hey all.  Just felt that i needed a change  so i have deleted all previous posts. they were boring  anyway.  My grandmother is in the hospital again. she's been puking and having dizzy spells  and the doctors don't know exactly what's wrong with her. so much for modern technology.  Read the  Da Vinci Code  by Dan Brown. interesting book. it argues that Jesus was not divine  and that the church invented his divinity. Also argues that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. well i'm not going to go in depth to argue anything  but i think Dan Brown made lots of mistakes in his assumptions. for example  he writes that Peter was the one in the picture "" The Last Supper "" who was making threatening gestures. apparently that man is Judas Iscariot  not Simon Peter. that explains a lot about the hand gestures.  Anyways  there's a reason why the book is under the fiction section in book shops and libraries.  Thinking of getting a new cpu.  Thinking of you  too.  Bye all. ",0
  As some of you might have known I had an interview with Dierburgs and it went really well. But today I got a letter from them saying Thanks but No Thanks. I guess its back to job hunting for me. This really sucks I was so ready and I really needed it too. Totally of subject here but would those stupid telemarketers (no clue how to spell) please stop calling us  were on the no call list thingy.  Later ,0
  Ok  every one else is like doing things every single day except for me. I just sit around all day doing nothing. This is so stupid. OOOOO I get to go to Texas. I'm so excited Texas. Can you catch the sarcasm. If not then um yeah. That's all for now. I just thought I would share that.  Later ,0
  Well I can tell that it's summer now. I've already slept into 12:00 pm one day  I've stayed up till 2:00 am and I'm waiting to pull an allnighter.  It's starting to get really hot outside  man am I happy that we have a pool. Not that I use it that much. But if I ever need to I know that it is there. O yeah  I saw Shrek 2 it was awsome. There are still some movies that I wanna see. Well I'll post some more stuff later. ,0
  Ok everybody. I'm going to admit I'm  not the most unfortunate soul out there. And I feel bad. So I want all of us to start praying for Kellie's friend who just lost everything in a fire.   Psalm 23 A psalm of David. 1 The LORD is my shepherd  I shall not be in want.  2 He makes me lie down in green pastures  he leads me beside quiet waters   3 he restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  I will fear no evil  for you are with me; your rod and your staff  they comfort me.  5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  6 Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life  and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.  Wow I love that passage.

"  So here I am...one of those people who likes to hide behind who they really are...someone who is afraid to express their honest opinions because they don't want to hurt anyone. But this is fun because there isn't a single person (well  okay  except maybe my sister)  who know that this is really me. Let the fun begin!!!  To give you a better idea of who I am and what I like  I figured that I would start out with some websites that I check frequently. I get my basic news headlines here: www.usatoday.com. I also really like the sight because it has a lot of entertainment news and fun chats so when I am really bored at work  I can bug people besides my coworkers (which is a word that I have never really liked because every time I look at it  I only see the word ""cow."" Granted  some of my coworkers have been along the ""cow"" lines  but still...that is just mean).  I am applying to law school for the fall- mostly because I don't know what else to do and I am actually entertained by the thought of spending 3 more years in school. So I check out www.review.com  www.lawschooldiscussion.com  www.xoxohth.com  and www.lawschoolnumbers.com for some up to date information. Okay  so I am actually really excited about going to law school. I know that millions of people are doing it- so I thought that I would be one of those millions. No  just kidding... I know that the job market will be tough when I get out but it is tough right now and I can't stand my job. Why not get more edu-ma-ca-tion? It is almost funny...I haven't told my friends that I am going to law school. I have good reason but that is definitely something for another entry.  I love to travel and like to check out www.elliott.org for info about deals and new travel news.   I also check out www.eonline.com for celebrity news- yes  I am one of those people. But I have to live vicariously through someone so why not someone beautiful  thin  rich  and famous?!?  Okay  enough for today...I am sure that this is not interesting to most people but it is a lot of fun for me to write and I am sure that it will allow me some creative genuis. Have fun! ",0
"  Welcome to my ""Hello World"" post!  I am on a mission!  My wife  whom I couldn't love more if I tried  has had the wonderful luck of having her job relocate us to Orlando Florida!!  YEEEAAAHHHH!    We love Disney World and have been at least twice a year since we were married back in 1991.  We most recently took the Disney cruise and absolutely loved every minute of it.  We have two kids  a boy who is 9 and a girl who is 7  and they both love Disney World as well.  So you can imagine our elation at getting to move to Orland!  Then reality struck us!!  My job doesn't have an office in Florida!  Oh no!  There is no way we could move if I didn't have a job to move down there to (we currently live in Indianapolis IN).  Well I work as an IT Manager/Project Manager so I thought I'd just hit MONSTER and DICE and bingo  the job offers would roll in!  WRONG!  After applying to over 30 job postings I haven't had a single reply of interest.  Ok so the first thing I did was get introspective.  Is it me?  Am I not employable in the year 2004?  Then I thought it was my resume  so I had a professional help me out with that.  He polished it to a fine sheen and I resubmitted it to DICE and MONSTER.  Guess what!!  STILL no hits!  I spoke to a recruiter in Florida who has assured me that I will NOT get any hits because I do not live in Florida!  WHAT!  I'm not even asking for relocation fees!  My wifes job has that covered.  This is so frustrating that I just have to share this with the rest of the world  or whoever reads this that is!  If you are reading this and you can help me  please do and God bless you!  You can contact me at goofybk@insightbb.com.  Even if you can't help me  feel free to email me and we can chat about this frustrating topic.  Can I be the only person looking to move to Florida who is experiencing this?  Please at least let me know that I am not alone here!  I will be posting daily so look for more tomorrow!  I'll close with a little Disney Magic -  ""When you wish upon a star  makes no difference who you are  you'll never get a job in Florida  if you don't live there!""""  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! ",0
  My first blog! I know its kinda cheesy after other people have already had one but...what the hell. It gives me something to do other then gay msn. Anyway  It was Colour Night tonight. It was...Colour Night. Nothing Special. Tyson won for the SRC President and I brought home Top Male Jr. in track and not a single academic award...as usual. After that  Mitch  Scott  Kendra and Me went cruisin around for abit and went to the FT. It was fun. It was better then doing homework at an old ladies house... Anyway  Time for bed...Later ,0
  Again  Not a lot happened to me today. It started off regularly  showered got dressed  ate and so forth. Then I decided to play MSN before I went to school. I saw that Kendra was on so we talked about the hot gossip in town... it was mainly about the Jarret and Sarah and their new found love. I got to school abit on the late side  but I just had Bio so I didn't give a damn. Then we skip ahead to 3:15  because school is gay and I don't want to talk about it. I really felt like doing something after school just because I didn't want to go home. But everyone was preoccupied so I had no other choice but to go home. I then decided I would go for a drive to kill some time. So I'm driving down main when I see a group of hutterites trying to cross the street. They were already almost half way across when I started slowing down. When they saw me  it was as if I was the Anti-Christ. All 4 of them just start scrambling around. They looked like fucking retards out there. So 2 head back for safety and infront of the Co-op and the other 2 bravely take the risk and proceed to the other side. I was so close to rolling down my window and start yelling at the the retards...Fuckers   That was the most exciting thing that happened to me today.   Then I went over to the school to see what Big K was up to. He was doing some stupid accounting shit with Connie. He asked me to go get his pictures from the Parasave for him. So I did that  then I went over to Radio Shack to see what was new there. Mitch was there but he was TOO BUSY TO TAlk...So I once again left. After about other 5 minutes of driving I got bored and went home. The rest of my night was then followed by  eating  MSN  then homework.   That pretty much sums it all up. I am tired now and ready for bed. Later ,0
  Today I woke up at 10:20 and as usual went downstairs to watch a little TV. Then I came upstairs to go on the Internet. I've currently been online for 49 minutues. I don't know what I will be doing today. I think I might go pay my phone bill  other than that  watch TV    go online. You can't even go outside because its raining and dark out. Oh well.  Later.  P.S. Oh yea! I'm going to watch the finals basketball game tonight. GO PISTONS!!!!  GAME UPDATE: The Pistons beat the Lakers by 20 points! And the Lakers got the lowest score ever in game three!!!!

  On the last day of school a very close friend of mine that I've known since preschool and another friend went to Wendy's. Here are their pics:   urlLink    Here's the friend since preschool.  urlLink      urlLink    Here's another friend in my Bio class.  urlLink     We walked downtown to Wendy's and came back to school to hang out.

  urlLink    ME at School.  urlLink     This is me at school on the last day. On my next post I'll show the pics when some friends of mine go to Wendy's. Mmmmm Good. ,0
  Hello  Well really haven't done nothing today. Been waking up around ten each morning :). I might go to the movies tonight  time permitting. But just been watching TV and going online. I think I'm just being lazy bacause I'm recovering from all the hard work from the school year. Hmmm  I don't know what I will be doing this weekend. I'll post again tomorrow. BYe. ,0
  Hey  I've been kind of busy since Sunday. On Sunday I went to my grandpa's for a cookout  then I went to get my haircut  afterthat I went to my great grandma's. THEN I went to my grandma's. WOW  a lot in one day. And today I really didn't get a chance to go online. I went to the park and stuff.  Right now I'm just tired. Hopefully I'll post again tomorrow. BYe. ,0
  Today I had so much fun.  I met a new guy  his name is Kenny.  I met him at my friends house where we were rehearsing are skit for the MDA fair.  Kenny is the magic mirror in the skit.  He is hilarious. Most of his part is him just making stuff up off the top of his head.  He is 18 and acts like a 15 year old.  Today he tackled me  it was so funny because I play insulted him and he jumped me. We called a truse after that but kept messing around.    most of my friends are guys.  I don't really know why but they are.  I just feel really comfortable around them.  When I am around girls all they do is gossip and talk about you behind your back.  But guys are not like that at all  except for the gay ones but I only have one gay friend.  The guys I hang out with are usually what people call geeks or nerds or whatever you want to call them.  Have you noticed that all the really nice guys are nerds or geeks? ,0
  Looks like an other boring summer.  But this time I am with out my two best friends. Well they used to be my best friends.  I don't think I did anything but we more have just grown apart.  I have just completed my first year of high school.  Now I am really wondering where the time went. I can't even remember what I did most of this year.  But I guess that is just high school.   right now my life is kinda a mess. For starters my parents are ganging up on me and it is getting really old. And my sister is being a real bitch to me.  When he bf gets back from Hawaii she will be back to normal...I hope.  Then there is my love life.  Right now it is taking a break because my bf is working at a summer camp and I can only see him when he comes home on Saturdays. Which really sucks.  He is a junior  my parents hate that I am dating him. They would rather have me date someone my own age.  But if you know me you know that telling me not to do something will make me want it more. Some of my guy friends were upset when I told them about my bf.  They are a bit protective of me. And they are all like brothers to me except for one... ,0
  Started Drivers Ed. again today. I would of already had my permit if I had not gone on vacation to Florida when I was taking the class for school in Feb. but I have to admit  the trip was worth it. On the bright side  I only have to go for 15 more days. July 1st I should have my permit if all goes well. When I got home  sense I'm now offically on summer vacation  I did what I've been wanting to do for a long time  absolutly nothing. I just sat around watching T.V. (of course nothing good was on -_-) but it was a good day. Other than that  I didn't do anything today. Planning to go to my friend Micheal's house tomorrow but he might already have plans  we'll see what happens. ,0
  I had drivers ed again today starting at 8:00 a.m. till 10:30 a.m. My mom drive me up there and I had to ride my bike home sense my dad was working and couldn't pick me up. Then when I got home  after about 30 min of sitting and watching t.v.  my dad wanted me to cut the grass. So I had to do that  took me about 45 min and during that time  my friend Andy called. Went over to his house after I was done. Played some 21 and some smackdown for ps2. When I came home  my mom and I went to pick up some mcdonalds. My mom got a big mac which had a free download code for www.connection.com. Got a free music download  along with one that Andy gave to me cause he got one from his work for free. He happens to work for mcdonalds too. When I got done with that  I came online and sat around watching t.v. like I am doing right now. :) another fun day. ,0
  Well I must admit that I have gotten into all of the hype about this new mail account that google is offering. Called GMail  and I have seen alot of people already with account even though they are in the beta stage. People are getting invites from other people but nobody has invited me yet. When I do get a invite  I would really like to have andrew@gmail.com but I highly doubt that it will still be avaliable to use. It's always nice to want stuff isn't it?  I'd also like $1 000 :) send it to me by mail  thanks. ,0
  In this process of letting go  I am finding that the most courageous act I can to is to also  let in . Change is the only constant in life  but it never seems to get any easier to move beyond the attachments of my heart and head.   I find that sharing my stories is a part of my process of healing.  It provides release  but also accountability.  In a way  this log is a letter to my future self; a reminder; a chronicalling.    Taylor and I have broken up more times in the past 9 years than I can even begin to count  and in recent years those endings have been becoming more and more final  as we sought other loves and different paths.  But we always seemed to find our way back to each other again.   This time there is a sense of finality.  Despite our best efforts  we just can't seem to move beyond our struggles.  It is heartbreaking to think of leaving behind my best friend and all of the dreams we shared for our future  but it is also exciting to think of the possibilities life has in store for us.    I take solace in the small things...  Puddle jumping on my way to the corner market this morning Birds enjoying all of their new baths after the rains last night Kids in a single file line on their way to a field trip  I am seeking new adventures: meeting new people  exploring new places  new things.... Letting in and  taking in   the world with a new perspective  a lightness  an openess.   The past 3 years have brought a lot of loss and lessons.  I have had to mourn my grandparents for the second time as the dome was sold.  I had to let go of Taylor to be with Mark  who brought a lot of joy  but even more heartache  and then regret that I had hurt Taylor to pursue such a fruitless endeavor.   I have always tried to follow my heart at any given moment  and sometimes the choices that follow are painstakingly difficult.  I can't help but feel that some of those choices have contributed to these insurmountable trials between Taylor and I.  He moved on long ago.    And now I must begin to.    I have learned so much in the last few years; about love and life  and mostly about myself.   I live my life with the faith that everything happens just as it is meant to. I must trust the unfolding  let go  and let in. ,0
  A letter of complain  Dear Ms Tang  I really must have to complain about the summer camp that organized by your company. I was one of the first students from my school to go to this camp. Expecting a relaxing camp  the camp was totally a disaster! There were many problems in the camp  such as there were holes on the tents  all the sport equipment was broken  foods were horrible and a very dirty beach.  On the first night of the camp  it rained. So we decided to stay in the tent to play some card games. However  there were holes on the tents! The rain dropped through the holes and made us all wet. Also  it made us unable to sleep and even so  some of my classmates had caught a cough after that night.  Finally the rain had stopped on the next day  therefore we all got out and wanted to enjoy some sports activities. When we got to the sport equitmenp room  we found that all the things were broken. We couldn't play football because the football had a hole and so do the basketball. We also couldn't play the tennis because we couldn't find the tennis ball. All the things there were like a mass and made the room just like a rubbish room. At that day  we did nothing until noon and all of us were bored.  Hoping for a delicious lunch  the food was awful. The food was badly cooked. For example the fish had bad smell and seemed that it had been cooked a long time ago. The soup was the most horrible dish. The color of the soup was black! We didn't want to eat them  but we were all hungery and there were no restaurants nearby  we had to eat them. In the afternoon  many of us felt sick and had a stomach-ache.   The advertisement of this camp said that there would be a beautiful beach near the camp site for us to swim. However  the beach was terrible too. The beach was full of cans  glass bottles  paper and so do the see. We all disappointed about the camp and we all thought that this was the worst camp that we even had.  I was totally not satisfied by the services that provided by your company and we are claiming the total cost that we spent on the camp which is totally five thousands six hundred dollars. If you don't give us the refund  we will take further action by sending complain to the consumer Council.  I'm looking forward to receiving your prompt reply.  Yours faithfully  K. Ng. K. Ng. ,0
  i hate this i am hiding this life the real me and no body knows it i wish they did then they would ask me to talk to say what i want to say and then i could stop saying jst what they want to hear and mabye i could say what i want to hear and then mabye i would be happy with my self i wish i were me and not what they want to see it is sssooooo anoying trying to act like this just so they  can be happy of corse this kinda what every body wants for me to try and ft in and hid the real me because i go agaonst everything that my parents wanted me to be i hate every thing that  they hold so dear like stupid basseball ur camping or fishing.  they say that i have pinko liberal ideas what evr that means but i thnk that what i havve to say is right i think that we should try  to save the whales instead of helping themon thier way to extinction and they say it merely nature well it isnt it is more than that it is killing what god has so graciously given to us and putting it to ite death that isnt how they see it but that is how i do which is just one way thatwe are differnt ,0
  My best friend in the world has turned on me  She says she loves but I dont think she does I wish I were dead She says she wants to hang out but she never calls She used to sit next to me and trust me But it has changed  I used to be her best friend in the whole world But that has changed And whenever I think about it I cry  I actually cry  She said she was sick  So I made her a card (I even got Tommy Gus and Angela to sign it) And got her a beautiful flower from the store But when I called to see if I could go drop off her presents  She wasnt there she had gone to the store with her other friend- her better friend (Even though she is always going on about how she doesnt want to spend her money) And of course she didnt call You cant say this is jealousy  Because you know that this is hurt I wish she were here  And I wish I were dead (Not that she would care) And now my tears splatter the keyboard ,0
"  Yesterday I went to my Grandpa's wedding! (Yes  my ""Grandpa."") It was at a super fancy country club called ""Glen Acres"" and it was beautiful! I was all dressed up and wore make-up and heels!I (looked great.) It was a good thing we brought our digital camera too! I got to see many of my relatives that I haden't seen in years. Especially my favorite cousin Brent! We practically grew up together. You should have seen the ladies lounge! It was carpeted and had couches and bathrooms and even showers! My little brother told me that in the mens lounge they had a pool table! I had an amazing time  and I got to meet a lot of new people. I even cought the bouquet of flowers that the bride throws. But I doubt I'll be the next to get married since I'm only just turning 15 in 10 days! I had so much fun that I didn't wan't to leave. I'm going to remember that day forever! ",0
"  Wow time went by fast! Tomorrow is my birthday! A lot has happend since the 13th. School is finally out! I'll be going to Evergreen High School after summer vacation. And I can SLEEP IN! I've been so tired that I was falling asleep in my classes! But amazingly I have been on the honor roll for the whole year! The pool is OPEN! YEAH! I have been dying to go swimming in this heat! Can't wait to get my ears pierced on Thursday w/Jessica and Rose. However  Rose just told me and Jessica that her mom's day off is Thursday and her mom now wants to come along with us to the mall too! NO WAY! My mom is already taking us and she said that if Rose's mom is coming  then she's not taking us at all! I agree. Rose's mom was pretty mean to Cynthia when she told on Rose for pushing her.(She acctually made her cry!)AND........ Rose told me that her mom told her that she doesn't like it when Rose walks w/us to the library n' stuff because she thinks that me and Jessica act like we're so cool and that we dress up all pretty just to go to the library! That is soooooooooo not true!!!!! I think she's just jealous!!!!!!! That made me so mad! I told Jessica and she didn't like it either. We don't dress any different from the way we always do which isn't trying to be ""PRETTY!""   HOW RUDE! ",0
  Oh my gosh how gay am I!?! When I got my ears pierced it didn't even hurt! I was scared for nothing! So stupid! ,0
"  Geuss what? I just realised how great I am at reviewing movies. Remember when I saw that one about the British ravers who contacted the undead via an Oujia [I've never had to spell that word] board? The one about the kids who snorted coke [cocaine  for those of you who aren't Ma-  er  down with the street speak] off train tracks when  wait for it  A TRAIN WAS COMING?  I also liked how they had sex  and the girl's shirt was on inside out for the rest of the film. Oh  but I wish I had seen all of it. Obviously  something that starts off like that must have a grand finale. But my mum wrestled the remote off me with a stern ""No more tacky B-grade films about British punks!""  But they weren't punks  mum. They were ravers.  The whole experiance left me hungary for more B-grade films. The 'B' in 'B- grade' stands for 'Brilliant'  right? Oh  good. Anyway- Blurred.   IT HAD EVERYTHING.  A deformed freak who picked up hitchikers  playing a recording of a woman having multiple orgasms  in his wagon of death?  Hillbillies eating lasange?  Threesomes in a limo? The driver wearing a cocktail dress?  A stripper-hating nerd who fails to find true love?  Some ugly bitch who picked up an even uglier bitch [male  this time] and attempts sex with him? Several times?  Gothic girls on acid?  One of those great endings where they freeze on the face of each character and the text at the bottom of the screen tells you what happened to them after ""schoolies""?  IT. HAD. EVERYTHING. Am I one to be sarcastic? Exactly. See this film. Or the first one I raved about. Hahaha -RAVED.  Until the next time I go wild at the video store... ",0
"  Jesus.  Great bloke. Great head of hair.   I'm issuing a challange to everyone. To guys lucky enough to be blessed with long locks. To girls looking for something classic yet bold on their ball nights. Print out the following image of Jesus Christ and present it to your hairdresser. Ask them for ""The Jesus"". If they're a decent stylist they'll know what to do.  Why is Jesus' hair so underrated? Check out that colour. So... brown. And the volume! My god. Don't even get me started on the parting.  On second thoughts  I can't be bothered posting the image. You all know what Jesus looks like. And if you don't  consult your bible. ",0
  I've never been good at keeping a diary  so this may not work out so well.  Today after work  I had a surprise in that Jeff had called and left me a message on my cell phone.  I was very skeptical of ever hearing from him again.  I still do not know what happened over graduation weekend to cause the complete lack of communication between us recently.  I guess at some level I knew that we would never be able to work things out with 800 miles between us.  I was dreaming for a little bit.  I do believe things happen for a reason  however.  I just wish I could figure out the reason for having met James at this time in my life.  It's almost scary how perfect he is for me.  We have the same stupid sense of humor and understand each other perfectly.  I can't imagine him ever being an asshole or us ever staying mad at each other.  Why does he have to move to Texas in 6 weeks?  Long distance just isn't my thing.  So once again  I will get my heart broken and recover only to move on and get it broken again.  Which I guess is the way I prefer it.  I'm too young to settle down with one man.  I just wish I would quit meeting these incredible guys at such wrong times.   When am I going to get a break in love?    On the good side  I had a fabulous weekend.  I am beginning to love my new home here.  The possibilities are endless in this area.  I am making friends and figuring my way around.  Work is good...much better than I had thought it could be.  I guess I am a true geek at heart...who would have known?  I still don't think I could live here for the rest of my life though and be happy.  I think this is a great stepping stone though for 4 or 5 years.  Then it will be off to bigger and better things for me.  Maybe I'll move back home.  Or maybe to Texas... :)  who knows.  I love that I have so many choices in my life.  I really do feel very fortunate to have had all the opportunities in my life that have happened lately.  Life is good. ,0
"  UGH!!! TODAY IS FINALLY OVER!  Here is how the day went...  7:30am - Wake up call... Nicolas decides to wake up... ERRR! What happened to 9 o'clock!?  9:00am - Michelle's doctor appointment... Nicolas decides he doesn't want to be in the doctor's office... so we walk around for at least 30 minutes and about every 2 minutes he decides to drop his butt to the ground and pitch a fit.  10:00am - At the hospital and Michelle is with the Lactation Consulant Amy. Nicolas again doesn't want to be in the room... SOOO We walk around again but for this time it's at least an hour. I decided that he might be hungry so I took him in the elevator down to get food stuffs and NOW he decides he wants to be in the elevator the WHOLE TIME!!!!  11:30amish - Adam calls... THE SYSTEM IS DOWN!!! One of the servers puked and all the sites are down... It would have been a GREAT TIME FOR A NAP  but alas... I am the Jesus... Our savior... I spend like 2 hours fixing the server and everything is great.  2:00pm - Nicolas decides to wake up... I take him downstairs and make him Mac and Cheese... what does he do you ask? DOESN'T EVEN TOUCH IT! ERRR I swear to God... When he gets older... if I make him something  he better eat it or it gets the hose again!  5:30pm - Time for dinner... I cook  I clean... yay!  7:00? - Nicolas gets a bath... he cries the whole time... I don't know why... but I didn't brush his teeth :)  8:00pm - Awwww... relaxation... watch a little SNL w/ Lindsay Lohan... it was pretty funny.  10:30pm - I got a hair up my butt and decided to go play DDR... I completely suck now. I haven't played in a couple of weeks and it shows.  12:15am - I go to HEB to pick up a yummy treat for Michelle and to pick up cat food. Alas... I forgot the damn $$$ to pay for the stuffs. Do I look like a complete tard when I tell the HEB guy I forgot my Lonestar card at home. :P  12:25am - Back at home... everything is good...  1:20am - I now go to sleep... will I dream?   BTW - Some funny shit I found today on CNN... YAY!  ""On the other hand  I wouldn't just pull up and leave there if I thought it was going to cause the whole thing to disintegrate "" Clinton told King.  Hmm... I wonder why he didn't say... ""I wouldn't just pull out""? HAH! ",0
  Joel  Scott  Jeremy  Graham  and I built up my new SpecialEdlized frame Saturday night. Becky and Matt brought by their fit-stick and it made things a ton easier. Special crit gorilla thanks to them for sitting through our antics....I'm just glad they left before the slap fight.   McDaniels won  hands down...or up...well  actually perpendicular. Joel's neck was the biggest casualty our unit suffered.  I wish I had more seatpost showing. My compact frame looks like a semi-sloping Mercxk. At least the top tube fits me.  A long time ago  when I rode for Chisholm  a team-mate told me I had a gorilla body and I really only race criteriums  so I'll call this blog crit gorilla.   A great friend of mine  Shawn Moore  is blogging his trip with his wife out west at moorewest.blogspot.com. I was confused and inadvertently opened a blog account when I tried to post a comment. I figured I'd write a little while I was here. Thanks for the idea Shawn. ,0
"  I did my first real ride on the new frame during my commute home from work last night. I may need a new cassette  but I need to do some diagnostics before I throw money at the problem. My chain is slipping in the 21 19 and 18 cogs. The chain is new  of course  but the cassette only has twenty hours on it at best. I replaced my front inner chain ring after we built the frame up. It was worn slap out and you couldn't turn the pedals with any pressure without the chain jumping around like a lap dog.      My left knee was sore just under the cap and my hamstrings were aching during the ride in to the shop this a.m. I suspect my seat may need to come up a couple of millimeters  but the fit-stick says things are dead-on. If there is anything the past has taught me  it's not to monkey around with my position at the first sign of discomfort.      Ava and I made a ""tent"" with a bed sheet and two chairs last night. We huddled underneath while I read her favorite books.  I was supposed to go to my writer's group last night  but I stayed and spent time with Ava instead.  Typing it all up now gives me time to reflect on it and while last night I resented not going to the group (just a bit)  this morning I know that April  Ava  and I are all better for me being home as much as possible. Ape lets me ride more than most wives  I'd imagine  so it's hard for me to complain at all. ",0
"  Where does one start?? I guess by telling a bit about who I am  where I have been and where I hope to go.  I live in Northern California in a little community called Yankee Hill. We are situated between the towns (cities??) of Chico and Oroville about 80 miles north of Sacramento. I live on 10 beautiful acres where I bring dogs I rescue from the pound (no sweet sounding titles like ""Animal Shelter"" here!!) and train them to work with people with disabilities.  One February 20th of 2004  we placed our programs first Service Dog to work with a young girl with Cerebral Palsy. It was a really exciting event and after following up on them for the past 3 months  they are doing really great.   I am now working with 3 other dogs. One is being trained to work as a the ears for a hard-of-hearing person who also seems to be picking up the tasks needed to assist someone in a wheelchair. Her name is Polly and we believe that she is a mix of German Shepherd and Yellow Lab.  Starr is a Black Lab mix and she is being trained to assist someone with a wheelchair. Her progress seems to be slower  but I am still hoping that she will pass the program. If not  we will find her a good home as a pet or possibly keep her to be our demonstration dog. The only real problem with her is that she is not real confident in big city environments. She is about 15 months old  so there is still time to help her overcome her issues.  Then we have Mocha  a Chocolate Lab. We chose her for a specific client who has a spinal condition that is making it progressively harder for him to walk on his own. Mocha is being trained to wear a harness with a handle that he can hang onto and offer him balance and stability. We have only been working with her for a couple months. She also has had some issues for us to help resolve  the most major is a fear of having either her ears or tail touched as if she was picked up by them at some time. The other is that she has had a hard time staying in one place when someone moves near her. Both of these things are being addressed and we are having great success with her developing more confidence in a variety of situations.  Well  that is a start. I'll stop here and see how this looks and pick it up again later this evening. TA TA ",0
  Well I can't say that I'm upset right now with the way things are going.  M and I are talking all the time  and I can't get her out of my head.  She loves me :D  I love her too.  Now my only issue is the time...  I'm still afraid that two years would be way too long of a time right now  and then  even if we made it  it'd be another 2 and a half again before anything could REALLY happen.  N is still an issue  because she e-mails me constantly  and I stil care for her  but in the end  M will be mine.  I don't know what to do about N though.  I keep thinking about my life  and the person that I am.  I want to change stuff.  It's time that I clean up  and I plan to actually do it and stick to it this time.  For the first time in a long time  I'm happy with my life. ,0
  God women in this world should all just be shot...  Why is it so impossible to get one to listen to you?  When will them madness stop?  It seems like everything a man does during a fight only makes things worse!  I can't wait for N to get back from Wyoming...  I need to talk to her though.  Things aren't going exactly the way I wanted them to.  Wish I could go back and change it all... ,0
  God  it seems like no matter how hard I try there's nothing right in this world for me to hang on to...  Everything is so fubar.  What I wouldn't give to just go back to Italy!  Everything here in the states is so...  Arrogant and so brisque!  I suppose it doesn't really help that I'm in the middle of nowhere  but still.  The people of Napoli were better.  And they didn't give me the troubles that women here do.  No matter what  I can't seem to decide.  M  with her amazing beauty and sweet innocence  as opposed to N  with her attractive playfullness and OBVIOUS willingness  or B who I could have for as long as I wanted to be there  with a hug and with support  and to love me  but with intimacy extending only as far a kiss at the end of a date...  How do I decide what's more important? ,0
  Today was an ordinary day . . . I was off from Wal-Mart and didn't really have anything to do.  There's no food in my house  and it was kind of an adventure trying to find something to eat.  I'm really feeling too lazy to go to the grocery store.  I've been searching for Gmail invites and Orkut invites  but so far to no avail.  Gmail Swap has proven to be a bust as well.  Will has actually done more today than me.  He had some stuff to turn in for classes and wasn't gone long.  On days like today  we both feel like a waste of humanity  but it's nice to not have to do something every day of the week.  Sometimes  it's better just to sit around and have a lazy day playing with the dog.  Jen ,0
  I got two Gmail invitations!  As we all know  Gmail is hard to come by.  It's great  though  and I'm going to start using that instead of my provider's email.  I'm now on the hunt for Orkut invitations.  If you have any  please forward them my way!  Jen ,0
  I'm sitting here at 2:30 A.M. wondering . . . is it possible to fall in love with a place?  Is it possible to want to be somewhere so much that you would forsake everything . . . just to have a moment in that place?  I think that is what Chicago is to me  as corny as that may be.  I'm interviewing for jobs at the moment  and I can't sleep.  Part of me really wants the job  but another part wants to fly on a whim.  I know what I   should   do  but there is a great difference between what you should do and what you want to do.  I am so nervous right now--about the job  about the possibility of moving  about everything.  I'm literally at a time in my life when I am in serious upheaval.  It's a transition period  and I don't like it.  I wish I had a crystal ball that would tell me where I will be in five years  ten  twenty even.  Maybe then I would know the path that I am supposed to take.  But no one can tell you that  can they?  You can only do what you feel you should and hope that it is the right decision.  Jen ,0
  I hate my company.   Im miserable and its all my bloody inconsiderate bosss fault.  Although I also blame my Im-24 hours-busy-bf and all his smooth talks that for some reasons stop my questionings on his lack of attention towards me lately. I point my finger of shame at J for telling me that I can be pushy when I choose to be  my so-called dedicated lecturer who was supposed to provide me with the information on the 2 important major courses Im taking this semester so as not to land myself with another super stupid C+ and the entire family of Hitz FM for playing all the wrong songs at the wrong time.   I find the following people and creatures guilty of conspiracy to inflict misery upon me: my handphone for giving me trouble in typing texts  the taxi drivers for repeatedly taking the wrong routes when I repeatedly with my sweet looking face telling them  Please take the Pusat Sains Negara route and turn into your right after the traffic light  my missing brown sandals for not showing up although it has been nearly two weeks now  my totally chubby legs and most of all the boy bands in general for their I-cant sing-but-thanks-to-my-good looks-performances   I positively loathe men who approach the forever-so-romantic-in-the-head-women with their you-are-so-beautiful-pick up lines in order to get into their pants!!! ,0

"  I hate driving.  Yesterday I was in an accident which ruined my insurance.  I had already been in an accident where I filpped my car on a curve and toatled my 01 Civic  now I just totalted some poor girls Nissan.  Fuck!  I've decided to not drive for a while and get my shit straight  take a class.  I'm also pissed off because now I can't go see Dashboard Confessional in Duluth  GA on the 19th.  Oh well  we all know that God works in mysterious and often weird ways.  Maybe I'll learn something valueable in my class....or a girl...that would be nice.  A girl that can't drive like me.  The girl I hit was kinda hot...so I was trying to like ""comfort"" her...haha.  Oh yeah  another shitty detail was that she was the police's daughter...there should be a law against that.  Yes...Law enforcement personel's kids should not be allowed to drive.  Oh who am I kidding...I just fucked up....again.  I'll take it like a man and get another job.  Wreck + Wreck = More Jobs! ",0

Was that a sentence fragment?    Anyways.  I've decided to buy some fish.  I'm thinking guppies...but I may go exotic.  I'm dreading tomorrow because my dad informed me that I have to cut the grass.  I really don't want to say anything seeing as to how I've cost them over 14 thousand dollars in the past 5 weeks.  I figure that cutting the grass is the LEAST and is the very MOST I will do to make it up to them (yeah right).  How much money have you guys cost your parents?  I bet I beat you!  I really need to stop joking about this...it's starting to sound like I don't care  and I really really do.  I feel like shit.  I barely ate anything yesterday.  I had a footlong sub from Subway and some watermelon.  That watermelon was awesome.  I'm really ready for school to start back because I found out that if I don't have anything to occupy myself  I tend to bring on a lot of trouble. ,0

  Oy vey  its about three in the A.M. and I just got back from a midnight showing of Farenheit 9/11.   urlLink Wow.   There were reports of people actually being so appalled at this film to go as far as slashing the screen in anger.  And it's easy to see why  to put it bluntly  I love Michael Moore.  In short  it's about the bush adminidstration and such follies and gags.  Mr. Moore goes into the very bowels of the bush admniistration(too big of a word for this late at night) and brings up all the dirty secrets that they have been hiding in the past four years.  It goes from the election  to the patriot act all the way through the war in Iraq.  Not only that  but he got to poke fun at bush the entire time.  Its good wholesome family fun.  Actually I shouldn't say that  there are in fact a lot of very graphic scenes that were incredibly hard to watch.  A lot of things that made me incredibly angry that this could ever happen.  Even though some of these things were very difficult for me to watch  it is necessary to know about such things so that we can know what is going on in our nation.  There are also  urlLink a few points  that I wanted to be put in that weren't.  This movie also made me incredibly frustrated that I  still being a minor  cannot vote on this topic.  The movie is two hours and three minutes long  is rated R and should be angering republicans in a theatre near you. ,0

He used to scuba dive a lot in the past - he swears he saw a shark while diving in Hawaii  though couldn't take a picture of it underwater- guess he was too freaked out or something.  we'll see how it goes.

  I am trying out this blog thing.    A little info about me.     I am a 26 year-old female  a Spanish teacher  married  living in Texas  I have two dogs and am enjoying my summer vacation    I am not sure if I am getting this blog thing.  Sure am reading some interesting  thoughts  ideas  opinions and the like . .   perhaps later I will have more to share ,0
  So we did the Oklahoma thing.  It was actually a very beautiful lake.  On Saturday  as soon as we got into OK  it started pouring.  We were worried that our fun-filled weekend would be ruined because of the rain.  We had nothing to do.  We decided to see DODGEBALL  which was silly.  When we came out of the movies  the sun was out and the sky started to clear.  We dashed over to the lake to rent a kayak.  It was really nice and not too hot since it had been raining all day.  We then ate dinner at a local restaurant.   Sunday's weather was better.  My husband enjoyed the scuba diving  though it was not my cup of tea.  I am not certified and just sat on the shore  under the trees  trying to avoid the sun.  I told him that I might not go with him the next time he decided to dive  since it is not very interesting for me.  I know he enjoys it so much  but is definitely not a spectator sport.   I am teaching classes in a summer program for high school students.  It is going well  though some of the kids don't seem to care very much about the program.  They seem to be determined to get kicked out of the program (which will provide college tuition upon successful completion ).  I don't know.  Hopefully these kids will wake up and realize that this is a unique opportunity before they are removed.  I know that they deal with difficult stuff at home - things that I never had to deal with. . . . ,0
  Ok Guys  this story's worth hearing. So Monday morning I'm woken up at 6:15am by this really loud beeping noise  so I tried to turn off my alarm clock  but thats not what was beeping. So I laid in bed for a few moments  blinking stupidly  then heard my mom yelling somehting from what seemed like really far off  and I realized all of a sudden that it was the SMOKE DETECTOR going off!! So I jumped out of bed and opened my door  and this WALL of smoke came pouring in! I quickly woke up my brothers and got them outside  then went back in to investigate. I hurried over to our kitchen  and arrived just in time to see out microwave melt and fall into pieces!! Our kitchen was in flames  the walls  the counters  the floor  the stove  microwave  refridgerator...Oh man. My dad somehow put it out  and I am now practically living in my basement  while about 500 people come over every day to repair or clean our house. Wow. So that was my adventure for this week. Peace out  A-town!!  ~Chel~ ,0
"  Let's see... what to write  what to write. Ok  last night I was at the house in Florida with my friend Kendra. She was in the kitchen filling waterbottles with iced tea for the next day  and I was in the bedroom with my earphones on. Suddenly she appears in the doorway to our room with this frantic and terrified look on her face  so I dropped my music and ran after her as she sprinted back to the kitchen. We tried to whisper since everyone else was asleep. ""What?"" I whispered. ""IT'S A F***ING ROACH!"" she scream-whispered. ""I just stared at her  uncertain at which I was more surprised at- the roach or her language. Then I just started laughing. Man  the look on her face. Ha. Peace out  A- town. ~~Chel ",0
  I really don't want a blog  but Kendra is MAKING me one so I guess I should write SOMETHING for it. I hate blogs. I think they're dumb and pointless and no one ever wants to read them. I mean  seriously  most people don't want to sit there and read about what someone else did all day long. So why would you be interested in what I've been doing? So my blog is going to be unusual  hopefully somewhat interesting. Talk to y'all later!!  Peace out  A-town!   -Chel ,0
  Well  this isn't exactly poetry  but I'm just not feeling very inspired at the moment.  Of course  that could be due to the fact that it is 2:33 AM where I am currently located.  Anything I try to type that isn't planned will most likely not be coherent.  I'm very tired  but I don't really feel like sleeping.  Strange.  I'll probably sleep in tomorrow until 12 and then be a pain in the ass all day.  Such is life.  Anyways  I'm going to attempt sleep.  I'll put up a poem tomorrow or something. ,0
  The Fall of the Pure  A tear falls from my eye Into the sea Where has it gone? This thing called humanity My tear is lost In the great abiss of purity where dwells a style so sweet and free The swells of sweetest revelry  where friends are not lost and love doesn't end where the signs of the time are not peoples' sins where hatred and darkness are not known where the beautiful are not alone  it lightens up each soul with truth and all are hearkened to the light of youth such in these souls  is purity a neverending  and lovely chastity  but while man reigns so does hate it floods our souls and swells over the gates the purity wanes the truth wavers the hate holds fast and we await a saviour  When will he come to take away our doubt For all this pain Can't be what existance is about What light he giveth me I pass to you And hope that your soul Will to hope hold true ,0
  Try not to cry Don't let the pain show When your fears hurt the most Just let them go No regrets You told me with a smile But I didn't listen I still cry  You live a life Doubtless and free of pain and worry 'free of misery' I wish I could live by your wise creed but I can't block emotion It won't let go of me  I look up to your wisdom I admire your strength But I can't follow your footsteps For I am still week A fledgling of truth Yet living in lies this is the lifestyle you so despise  This is written for my cousin Harrison  who though he is 6 months younger than me  has always been a sort of mentor.  He's there for me in tough times and gives me advice on what I need advice on the most  life. ,0
  Today? Is a word  which means the present day  time  or age? So today would be  June 17  2004  the time 2:00AM  and the age not sure yet. How about I rewind back to this morning and then tell a little about what got me here today  (Place here the most annoying sound in the world) that would be my alarm. Its 10:30 in the morning (I just went to bed 5 hours ago) so what do I do? I hit the snooze button. Six thousand beeps and an hour later I finally decide to wake up but not by choice. My sister Whitney runs into my room and tells me something dont know what she said because my mind was still on weather or not I was wearing cloths. By time I got up and took a shower puts some cloths on. I figured out that she was telling me that the food was ready my Step-Dad had made lunch. So I eat then walk back to my cave (my room) to continue my computing experiences. Which doesnt ever end.  From there on I just sat and sat watched some movies and listened to some music. Talk on the devil I mean AIM. 8 hours later I go to the best place to eat SUBWAY. Then I retreated back home to continue my online enjoyment. This went on till about a hour ago when I remembered a Tech TV show called Call for Help (use to watch it a lot till the show got canceled a few weeks ago)  Where a guy said something about blogger.com. So I was like what the heck  and checked it out. So here I am now setting here in the dark  except the glow from my monitor writing about the most boringness day in the world  or just close to it.    Now for some info about my Family and I. Family  4 sisters and 2 brother and older  which would make me the youngest and Im 15 year of age.  The oldest 30  my parents are divorced and both re-married. One of my brothers is in Iraq; the other is in Wichita Falls in Texas going to collage. By the way I leave in Texas  Fort Worth actually. One sister just graduated and then other will next year.       Well now that you know a little about me  made you might be able to understand some of my anger sometimes and maybe you cant ,0

  Hahaha!  What an orginal title for this entry!  I don't know what to name it! This is the first time I have writtien in here!  I'm so hungry!  My mimi is making me something to eat.  I really should have eaten a bigger lunch!  Work was so boring!  Me and Adam just sat there the whole time!  There was no one in there watching us and we were so confused half way into the training! We  what we thought was done  didn't know what to do next!  I was walking around with no shoes on in the main office looking for someone to come and help us! LOL!  I finally found someone to help us and we ended up having a ton of lessons to do. They were so stupid.  Poor Adam started nodding off five mintues into his.  Mine wasn't that bad.  I was actually doing my lessons and not falling asleep!  I was trying to learn!  Unfortunately  I have to train AGAIN tomorrow  but Adam isn't going to be there so I am going to be all by myself! :...(      Moving right along!  Haha.. I just found out that Madonna is changing her name to Ester!  Haha! What the hell!! She is f-ing Madonna!  She can't change her name! Blah to her.. I don't like her anyways!  I miss Erik!  He hasn't really been gone that long and only has a week and a couple days before he comes back home.  I can't wait to see him.  I miss him ALOT!  We made our first HUGE decision together yesterday.  We decided on going to Cameron our first year of college and go  to OU our sophomore year.  That works for me.  I really want to go to OU  but I can wait a year.  OU isn't going anywhere!  Haha!  It would be better that we wait to go to OU and we go to Cameron our first year.  That way we can keep our jobs and continue saving money for our appartment and everything.  I am really excited that we made that decision.  I can plan out the next couple of years of my life now.  I just need to tell my dad and start getting everything I need to get into Cameron next fall.      Well  I don't really feel like typing any more!  I've been typing all day of the computers at work!  I will just write tonight and then type it in tomorrow before work. I'm going to go talk to Erik William....                                          June 17th  2004     Hahahaha..

  Okay  so I just spent $50.00 bucks on a optical mouse.  It was either that or spend the money on food or shoes.  The new pet is a Logitech MX510 optical mouse  it is a cool maroon color and if you want to buy into the sales pitch each color is unique with no two the same.  The performance spec's are what cinched the deal for me..i did not even know that they had performance specs.  I got 5.8 megapixel per second image processing  800 DPI resolution  and the solar flare reductor units are top of the line from NASA.  So technically with all this going for me  my online gaming experience should now vastly improve as I fight for world domination with 13 year olds (yeah right).  The one  for real thing is I did find a article about the mouse in Maximum PC magazine.  It got thier trademark (kick ass award).  That has to be worth $50.00 bucks. ,0
"  It is weekends like this  that make Seattle a great place to be.  Spending alot of time out on my back deck (temps in the 80's).  Spent yesterday afternoon organizing the neighborhood water gun fight.  It seems that over the last few summers I have aquired a small arsenal of super soakers  and squirt guns  so am able to arm most all of the neighborhood kids.  Really have to get a digital camera in the budget so I can post pic's.  It was not all play yesterday  as I was doing some side work (home networking).  This is the part of the post that could actually be useful for someone reading it.  Although most everyone I know that would read this is a techie.  Here it is  the three simple things to do  to keep your computer and/or computers and home network running smooth.  1.  KEEP those Anti-virus definitions updated and current.  You can actually schedule it to do it without any user intervention.  We would also like to ask all virus writers to please not spoof the email address of the dumbass who opened the virus in the first place.  We would really like to know who this person is.  2.  Run those Microsoft Critical updates  or get a MAC.  3.  Spyware is slowing down alot of the computers that I work on.  Download and run Adaware  its free.  I personnally recommend SpySweeper it tends to be a little more proactive.  There it is my feeble attempt to help people and computer relations.

  Good day my children. If you are reading this  you already know  I now have a blog.     Well school is almost over. Dear God  if this school year was moving any slower it'd be going backwards. Turns out I'm not getting straight A's  son-of-a-bitch! The end of school makes me think of Dazed and Confused  the best summer movie in the history of the world. But I just can't wait for school to end so I can fill my summer with sleeping until noon and then going outside and falling asleep by the pool. Sleeping is a skill that most don't take seriously  I can sleep whenever  or whereever I want  jealous? Well I've been ranting the whole time  which is good because I need to get it out every now and then. Well on a side note  the Sox won today  9-0. Did Derek Lowe win a game? Wow  maybe we can keep this going  and I can't wait for the Pedro-Bonds match up. Well now that I'm an Old Navy employee I can use walkie talkies and not be made fun. Ok  I must be going now  I hope you all enjoyed and come back again  peace. ,0

"  I need a job. A paying one. Not another unpaid internship where I drive 1.5 hours to get there  do crap work for 5 hours  then drive 1.5 hours to get home.   LA traffic sucks  but at least it's not as bad as Houston traffic. Or rather the drivers aren't nearly as bad. People here pretty much know how to drive. Houstonians DO NOT. They suck. They are rubberneckers to the Nth degree and cut you off and give you the finger. Here  people are calm for the most part and just sit and wait. Much nicer and more stress free.  I like it here. Maybe it's being away from family and friends that I grew up with or something but I think the only way I'll ever have a life of my own is out here. Just being around my family (who honestly are the *best* family anyone could ever hope for) makes me feel all this pressure to be someone or something. I feel like a different kind of person than them and no one has ever really made any effort to ""get"" me. I'm creative  they're not. They're obsessed with sports  I'm obsessed with tv and movies. When I'm with them I'm down on myself for not being about to get married like my cousins  or because I haven't been seeing the same person for 4 years like my YOUNGER brother. Going home to spend time with them is great  but it always makes me feel like my life is missing something because I'm not like them.   Out here  I fit in. Everyone's creative  everyone's obsessed with tv and movies. People out here have traveled and lived all over. They don't grow up in one town and marry someone they went to high school with.  I'm starting to rack up a list of former hometowns now though. Milford  Connecticut; Wake Forest  North Carolina; Poughkeepsie  New York; Houston  Texas; and Orange County  California! But I like that. It'd be sad to say I only ever lived in Milford or Wake Forest. Even if I don't *settle down* (ohhh how I hate that term) I have good stories to tell whoever'll listen!! ",0

"  Last night was not our typical Thursday night!  We started the night out with happy hour at Baby A's on Barton Springs Rd. Our friend had her 22nd birthday so we all hung out drinking their signature purple ""way too much everclear in them but we like them"" margaritas.  There is a known rule amungst my friends and I wish to share this with anyone who reads this...if you ever go to Baby A's for happy hour and you have 2 purples  go home or stop drinking!!!! We did neither.    You see  we had an urge...Lava Lounge is one of our favorite bars downtown for two reasons  1) it's located on 7th street around the corner from Fuel so it's nice to get away from the 6th street crowd! (For those of you that are not familiar with Austin  TX  sixth street is a popular strip that has about 60 bars adjacent to each other.) The music at Lava Lounge is formatted to fit everyones liking.  If you don't like the song on now  the next one will make you happy. 2) Lava Lounge is the home for our Bartender of the Month 3 months in a row! (Bartnder of the Month is voted on by our users)Walk up to the bar and ask for Gary  tell him you want the Marcus and Jack shot! Red Bull/Jager shots will come your way! Enjoy...oh yeah...tell him that ATXNIGHTLIFE.COM sent you!  We did make our way down to the Dizzy Rooster where it just so happend that Dax from MTV's Punk'd was at the bar.  We talked to him for a bit  and he said that he was in town filming a movie with Greg Kinnear (I think that's how you spell his last name).  It's funny how when you see someone on TV you have a certain idea of that person  but once you meet them  they aren't exactly what you imagined.  I pictured Dax as the party guy that goes out and drinks the night away.   Party Guy: yes Drinker: no But we had fun anyway! He was a pretty cool kat and the ladies sure loved him.    When we finished our sixth street bar hop  we ended it right where we started...Lava Lounge.  *From here on out  this is here-say: we walked into the bar and the place was packed!  We walked up to the bar 5 minutes past ""1st last call"" and Gary started making us shots.  The night couldn't have been better  good times with good friends  and one hell of a cheap tab!  Oh...I forgot to mention one thing...I met a midget who was an ex-pornstar! (or so he claimed...didn't matter cause he was surrounded by a crowd of girls  so we talked to him.)

  Well  I am starting a blog for the first time. I guess I will share a little about myself.   I am 27 years old. Married 3 years (August 18) to a wonderful man of God.

"  I am currently reading a book called ""Prayer Walking"" The concept is to strengthen you body as well as your soul. Hmmm...I think I am going to give this book a try. I do need to prayer more and get a stronger prayer life  and I do need to lose some weight. But in order to do this  I will have to get up early and actually get out there and walk. I think  once I am done with the book  I will actually get started. I will have to let you know how it goes.  Church yesterday was awesome! We had a powerful move of God and a total refreshing swept through the church. It was amazing! During last nights service  I got all the girls in the youth group up at the front dancing and jumping. It was such a great time in the Lord. Those girls are so special and God is doing great things in their lives. ",0
  I am learning to listen to God's voice. Sometimes he speaks in a voice so small  I have to stop what I am doing just to listen. Like this morning  I had this feeling to pray for my husband. I had to stop what I was doing and pray. I prayed until the feeling left. I don't know if he was in danger or not  but God lead me to pray for him right then and there. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I no longer listened to His voice. I don't think I am going to take that chance to find out.  I watched Jurassic Park 3 last night. I know  I am one of those people that actually like the movies. I really enjoyed number 3. It was a little different from the others. More action packed. My husband called me in the middle of it and told me I should be studying my insurance books instead of watching a movie. Well  he is right  but I finished the movie anyway.   My husband is working out of town this week. ,0
  Whoa! I really had no idea that college would be this difficult. I mean  maybe I'm still in the point of being culture shocked! Highschool is  way  different from college I tell you. Just don't know why it had to be very difficult you know. Anyway  that's how life works...never made it easy for anyone does it? ,0
  This is intense ever since I came to college. Never would have thought it would be this hard. Back when I was in Highschool  I really loved math! I don't know what happened. They just teach very fast in college. Not the usual thing I'm used to. So  wether people liked math or so  I'll find a waay or another to delete math out of my life.

  Speech Communication  is a  GE  course of mine..and one of my favored subjects as well as hated..  I love it because of our  teacher..Mr. Elmer Rufo..a gay..and a funny man..I mean..woman..as he would like to be. He's directing a play called Antigone. Never heard of it's story but we are obliged to watch it..since it's essential part is a review of the play..nice prof..  I hate it on the other hand..because...of my classmates. They're kind of different from the other classmates I have in other subjects. It seems very hard to go and have a bond with them. They seem the hard type of people to get along with.

"  Yesterday while shooping for my husband  i am usually very nice and polite and try to use as much German as possible. But I always don't have the write words or i just don't know the language that well to come up with a solution to my conversation. Anyway I went to this store here called ""Budnikowsky"". It is smaller to our Rite Aides or Drug stores in the States. The only difference is they don't carry drugs. On the Apotheke pharmacys carry any such over the counter remedy's. My daughter had dropped her binki or pacifier while we were walking and so i had to get a replacement for her and the best to go for that was Budni. Kowing that they carried such items. After getting my stroller in the store and wading threw all the people i had found what i was looking for. I then heading for the line to check out. Since the store is crowed most of the time even on Mondays  I had to push my way to get in line or other people would just get in front of you again with the no personal boudries issue. If you leave room for another person someone will think that it is meant for them and just cut in front of you no second thought. Well as i approached the counter of this young cashier  she of course never sported a smile to customers but instead basically looked up briefly and gave the look of NEXT! My turn! I said Hi! and she said Guten Tag  meaning Hello back. My total was 1 98 euros. I gave her 2. She then in turn was asking if i had any change but because I dont speak the language i didnt understand what she was saying to me. What kinda of change would she need for 1 98? Two was good enough. All she had to do was give me back two cents. But because i didnt understand what she was saying i did understand her body language which ended up in a huff and a puff from her. Like she was telling me you stupid idiot dont you understand and if you dont you dont belong in my line. Well of course after that gester and after dealing with my sick daughter all day shopping i had all I could take of the day and promptly recieved my change and replied to her  ""You know yo can eat shit!!"". From the look on her face i can tell she understood everything i said even in english. After that i felt great for the rest of the day. I find if you are nice to these workers they run all over you until you are nasty like them back and then they are your best friend.  Viki C. ",0
  Ok so boys are a major part of my life so I am going to be posting many blogs about them! First if there are guys out there reading this then I want to say that girls (in general) don't like to make the first move and surely hate to not know how a guys feels! I am actually turned on when a guy is able to express himself to me. Second I want to tell of something that has happened to me in the past. I hate it when guys are not able to act themselves if there is something between us. How immature is that...really. Then if a guy has a grudge against a girl I can't stand it how they center their lives around it and try to get back at them by getting on other girls and stuff. Once again that just proves they are immature and obviously don't know what they are doing. So guys learn to make the first move on a girl and get over the akwardness between girls and boys!! ,0
  Hello~ Welcome to my blog! I have a way interesting life so tune in later when I actually post something! ,0
  Hey~ I have to post and tell all my friends how lovely they are! I love the girls I dance with more then anything because they make hard work fun! I love my church friends because they always are there for me and my other friends do too much for me! They inspire me in ways I can't even tell...! You guys are amazing so I just wanted to say thanks! ,0
  To Whom It May Concern~ I am writing a formal apologie to a certain someone who I need to make peace with. This person should know who I am talking about...I wanted to say sorry about yesterday. I didn't mean anything in a bad way and when I was leaving your house I said goodbye and you ignored me. I just want to make peace because it was over something that I said that wasn't meant in a bad way at all. Call me please!! ,0
  So I went to see spiderman about the second day it came out... I loved it! The first spiderman has amazing action in it around the end  well in this spiderman there is action the entire way through. This one really has a great story and I encourage anyone who even remotely liked the first one to go and see this one! You'll love it! ,0
  urlLink    Beth got a new kitty yesterday. His name is Blackjack. He's hyperactive  has no respect for authority and meows constantly for no apparent reason. He bit my finger and made it bleed. The other cat hates him. I took this picture with Beth's palm pilot   hence the poor quality. ,0
"  Today is the last day of my 4th of July vacation. Then it's back to school for one day  then I'm off again Thursday  then school Friday  off for the weekend  school for three days then off again for six days. I don't know why they schedule two big breaks so close to eachother  but that's YTI for you. I had a pretty decent 4th. Each year both sides of my family have a picnic. They're usually on separate days  but this year they were both on the same day. First we went to my second cousin Jim's house for what is traditionally known as the ""Shinndig"" (I am descended from the Shinn family). This is attended mostly by people who I either don't know or only see once a year at this event. Afterwards  Beth and I went canoeing at Camp Blue Diamond. I hadn't been to Blue Diamond in years  but my parents used to send me there for church camp when I was a kid so it conjured up a lot of memories of not wanting to be there. It's a lot more enjoyable when I can do my own thing instead of being forced to do this or that and sing a bunch of stupid songs. We paddled around the lake for a while  enjoying the serenity of nature....or something. Then it was off to my aunt Wanda's house for picnic #2 where we ate food and watched my uncle and cousin and a couple of kids from accross the road set off fireworks in the rain. Then we headed to my grandmother's house for a little while before going back to my parents'. Overall  it was a good day. Good times were had by all and Beth got to see some wildlife she's never seen before  like dragonflies and a vulture (or was it a buzzard? I don't know the difference). I don't know how you can live for 26 years and never see a dragonfly  but that's Beth. Well  that's it for now. Maybe I'll update this thing again sometime. ",0

  I still have two weeks of the Associates in Internal Medicine  LTD left but I can feel my nerves tingling. Even Though it will be a full time job I really have no choice other than to view it as an endless learning experience. Which is is how I should really view everything. I will spend this time in anticipation and preparedness.     Since this is the first open-ended full time job based entirely on theatre  I see the opportunities for my future knocking. Loud. Slowly  but surely   I will begin the steps that have seen throughout my life. This journey will only end at my destiny which has continued to become clearer and clearer since the age of 8.  It's truly wonderful to be working side by side with GOD all the way; Even if he only shows up every once in a while. But I have no doubt as to where I'll end up  my only confusion is  how  I'll  end up there. I guess that's the fun of the journey. I guess.     The purpose of this blog will be 3-fold.     First: This will be a way to keep in contact with all my friends and family about information that pertains to my professional life.(Audio Mote will be the personal blog)     Second: This will be a way for me keep track of my learning curve. Excellent records should help expand and retain my knowledge as much as the application of that knowledge. And I hope to expand my exponentially for the rest of my life   Third: This will be an EXCELLENT way for me bolster my memory until I die. I've never been successful at keeping journals  yet I will make a valiant attempt to make this one stick. Constant recalls  admirations  regrets  and forlornings of all my memories will exercise and strengthen every one of them until the end of my days. This shall truly be wonderful tool.     Please feel free to post as many comments as you wish. I need them.  Try not to get bored with my blogs. They don't bore me.  Respect my opinion no matter how much it is conflicts with yours. This can be very hard.  And as always  logic will prevail over the illogical. This blog and my life depend on it.     read on and enjoy        -Dustin Mote  Chicago IL ,0
  O.K. let's get this stright first. I am a total Drake Bell Fan. I have tons of pictures of him in my room. I think If Drake would ask me to do something (even if it was so stupid) I would do it. I am his #1 fan. I also like Mary-kate and Ashley but not as much as Drake. I am also in 4-h and this year (it's my first year) and I am showing a llama named Fozzoli. I am involved in church and I am also homeschooled. Home-schooling stinks sometimes but it's ok. Like I only have 2 hours of school. This was our first year and I think we are going to be doing it again next year. This summer our cousin Ashley is staying with us. Oh yeah  I also have a brother. And a mom and Dad. My brothers name is Andy. I have lots of pets too. I have 1 bird (I used to have 3 but 1 had only one nostril and one lung and his name was Sammy and the other one  Princess   ran into the t.v. 2 days ago and broke her neck and died.) oh  the bird that alive  her name is Cinnimon. I have 20 fish (we don't really name them). I have 2 dogs Pokey and Flash (Pokey is 2 and Flash is 13)  the're  bassets. I have 1 cat named Baby. 1 Ferret named Teddy. 3 Sugar-gliders named Woodstock  Chip  and Dale. Oh yeah  and sometimes I count my brother as a pet. Sometimes  I like to babysitt for people. I really like watching kids  I guess it's my thing. I play the guitar. I have a lavender Fender Stradicaster. And I say I am really good at it. I think I am going to start a band with my friend Amie  she plays the drums. I think we would be a great band. And mabey we will get to meet Drake Bell and mabey he'll like us so we will go on tour with him and then he'll fall in love with me and then he'll marry me and we'll have 2 girls and... I think I am going a little nuts. I think we would make a great band though. I also dont have a boyfriend. Oh  and I am 13 year old girl. If I forogt anything I will be online tomarrow to inform you any more. ,0
"  I guess I should start out by telling a little about myself ...  I'm 16 years old  and I live in south florida.   I tend to  live  at the beach. I just don't understand how you can be so blessed as to be able to live on the ocean and not take advantage of it ..  I do things a typical 16 year old does  I guess. I love dancing  drinking  surfing  shopping  tanning  music  movies  and just hanging out. Okay  so I'm from boca raton  and as many of you  may  have heard  girls there tend to be shallow bitches .. I happen to be neither  unless you  really  piss me off ;)  Things that I live for are sunsets  sunrises  first kisses  hockey games..& players*:P  smoothies  FSU football  chocolate covered strawberries  dancing the night away  and gazing at the stars.  I want to be famous. I'm not really sure how I'm going to go about doing this  but hey  if it happens  I'll be thrilled.  I don't take things for granted. I live life day by day  and I try not to worry about what's gonna happen tomorrow. Life is short. I believe in forgiving someone who's hurt you  even if they don't deserve it. Don't judge a book by it's cover. Spend as much time with your family as you can  especially your grandparents. You can learn more than you've ever imagined.  I've never  really  been  in  love  romantically that is. I've loved a lot  but I'm scared. Scared of being hurt  scared of loving someone so much as to not be able to live without them. Lately  I've been finding out that trying so hard  not  to love  hurts just as much.  With one look at me  you'd probably label me as a typical ""dumb"" blonde bimbo. Hopefully  if you really take the time to know me  you'll realize that  even though I do have my ditzy moments  I'm not at all like my exterior shows.  I'm a sexual person. If you don't like it  then don't say anything to me. I'm not at all slutty  but I'm in touch with my sexuality. I believe that as long as you're comfortable with your body and who you are  then that's a perfectly fine thing to be.  I'm probably one of the  most  open people you'll ever meet. So  looking at me  you might not think so  but I am. I've been through a lot  and you'll find all of it out eventually.  Anyways  I guess that's me in a nutshell. I guess I'll be writing a lot more later  so hope to hear from all of you .. peace xo ",0
"  Stuff goes nuts as soon one gets mad.  As if somehow civility is erased from our brains and mindless matter comes out of our mouths.  Blows thrown at breakable things as if relief of someones frustration is inevitable.  Things twist as a tale changes and turns from moderate to worse.  My wife begged me to let her go her parents house   while I shaked my head in disapproval.  So I said ""ill make you a deal  I let you go but you clean the house tomorrow.  And get everything ready to go...and I mean everything! including me! get my clothes ready."" As time progressed somehow my wife lost track of time.  Then the time came for me to get ready to go to work.  My stuff wasnt ready as we agreed.  I let my wife know that im about to leave and im not taking her to her moms house.  She gets mad and storms out of the room while screaming  "" I have RIGHTS!!""  me thinking to myself.. ""Fuck man... I have the right to enforce what we had agreed on.""  The arguments got worse as she decided to resolve to threats of what she wasnt gonna do anymore. Of course that incensed me beyond borders of sanity as I thought on my head ""hey its not my fault you took forever in getting ready!!"" We went off to work and she dropped me off.  When the time came for me to come out of work she wasnt outside waiting for me.  I asked around if anybody had a cell phone to call my wife  and apparently nobody did.  So I waited 20 minutes till the next batch of employees came out  and asked them for a cellphone.  My wife answered to my dismay! I asked ""why are you not picking me up!""  She said ""You usually dont come early home so I figured you were gonna take a long time to get out.""  That got me so angry that I almost hit the windshield of my car.  She said ""I have RIGHTS!"" Infuriated as I was I struck the windshield and cracked it."" I was disappointed  but oh well its my wifes fault!!.  Of course I left alot of details out since im so angry right now that its consuming me from within.  It burns me inside as my spirit of goodwill fades into unusefullness.  What a shitty day. ",0
  Some times when i wake up i think that....yes today is my day and hence forth all those lazy habits must be a long forgotten dream and for the next five minutes i lie there planning my whole future.... well then after 5 min everything is gone and then the evil part takes control over the great brain... and after a while you feel that you are gone too deep and the shore looks like a distant dream...this is the flip side of the story...  Why.. why... why... why... why... i keep reading this everywhere and its keep hitting in my head all the while but then what the... whats life with out all these hangama..       Life's been on a marathon and as the day passes its like we need to run faster and faster or the world would leave you behind...Gosh and this rat race has made gone from wild to crazy...and when it comes to some thing no one has time.. Well then i guess that's life... life is sooo..... ,0
  Some times a person is so confused that he doesnot know what is he doing here in this world..he just lives the moment and doesnot plan anything....I do a lot of such stupid things in my life... and that make life so much packed that some times i feel that i do not have time for myself..why am i living like a fool and again i do not have time to sort this out....        I remember when i was in school I had the best of the friends one can have and there used to be a great joy or some good feeling when we used to sit together in the play time and during lunch time etc etc.... then as I grew i still have friends but its kind of different probably i need to feel good for all my real professional friends but i kind of like the people who consider me their yar and take me for granted....any way i can change myself thus i too am bit professional( i donot know if this word suits here) when it comes to friendship...keep it simple....But then you miss that kind of a friend who is really reliable and the one who you can go anytime when you have a problem... but then i guess its time to live yourself that's to solve your own problems and have a peacefull life.... ,0
  Hmmm . . . a blog.  It's something I've always thought about doing  but never did.  But I gave in.  Obviously.  Hmmm . . . . now I just have to make it interesting.  Hmmm . . . ,0
  But there are a couple of things I've been thinking about.  Does it make me a bad person that I want to just quit my alumni group?  Here's the problem -- I'm the president of our chapter.  I have been for about a year and a half.  But it's not like I volunteered for it . . . or at least not without a bit of arm twisting from the ex-president.  And now I can't find anyone to arm twist myself.  And I want out!!  There's just not enough time in the day to dream up events  organize them  send out a mass email announcing them  reply to responses  etc.  Then I have to actually show up at the event -- early to get seats -- and talk to people.  Well  the talk to people part isn't horrible.  The showing up early is the one that always kills me.  I have to show up early enough to ensure enough seats for everyonee who's coming (half of which probably didn't RSVP)  but late enough that I don't have to fight off the waitor for TOO long with promises of a coming party.  Uchhkk.  Let's see . . . what else.  Oh yeah -- I finally found a new apartment!  I'm pretty excited.  It's a one bedroom  so I'll be living by myself for the first time ever.  That's pretty nifty in some aspects . . . I can clean at my own pace (and only clean up after myself).  I can invite people over (or not) at my own discression.  I can decorate exactly as I like.  It'll be like heaven.  Except . . . I'm hoping I don't become a hermit.  Someone at work today joked that I'll be a cat lady.  I won't buy a cat -- I promise!!!  Hopefully it won't be so bad.  My current roommate will still be relatively close (she and her fiancee are moving in together).  My cousin will moving (with his wife) to a condo VERY close to my new place -- that'll be pretty nifty  cause I think we might be good friends -- we've never lived close enough to try before  but I've always enjoyed hanging out with him (and his wife) when I've gotten the chance.  Oh -- and I'll moving close to some friends-of-a-friend that I'm decently good friends with  too (and that I've always wanted to be better friends with).  So hopefully it'll all turn out well.  And it's a damn cute apartment  :-) ,0
  I had my last interview with Bruegger's this morning  and I am so happy to say that I got the job  and start Monday. I could have started tomorrow but I have a sprained ankle and its still swollen  so I guess I had better listen to mom --yeah I still do sometimes -- and stay off it for a few more days so it can heal. The manager's name is Steve  and he seems allright. We spoke briefly and then he showed me the store  which was very big and pretty clean  and then we sat down again. He said that I had come very highly recommended by his area manager  Theresa  whom I had met with on Friday of last week. I can't wait to work again  I quit glass doctor last week  and frankly I'm fucking bored all the time. Also  I so have bills  bills  bills. So at least I have a job now  and soon the money will flow again. I guess it kinda worked out that I fucked up my ankle when I did...its not like I have any money to go out  so I suppose its good that I cant. ,0
  Allright  so Bruegger's Bagels can blow me. The place sucks. The manager doesn't know how to train me for shit  and so another shift manager has been trying to  and she's really nice  but c'mon  its not her job! After about two weeks of getting up at 3:30am and working all day just kind of getting shown how to do things with a gun to my head  I can't take it anymore. The hours suck  the job blows  and I'm done. I wrote a letter telling them I quit  and I'll be dropping it off tonight after I pick up Mark. Done. Capeche? ,0
  Allright  I have a job again. I now am the secretary/customer service/first level tech at Lakeshore Computer Consulting  LLC and Midview Internet Services. My little brother is a tech there  so he got me the job. It's going allright  but the owner tends to swear a bit more than I am comfortable with. He kinda flies off the handle about really stupid shit  and has a tendency to make you feel like crap  so hopefully I'll just learn to let it go  and get used to it. ,0
"  One of my biggest downfall is that I'm too emotional. I realized this today  right now  before I logged on. My ""being emotional"" is causing a big problem. You don't realize how much you love someone until they're gone. Ever heard of it? Yeah  it's the famous cliche that you never think you can relate to.. until it happens. No it hasn't happen to me but I feel that I'm getting close and it hurts. I don't want to give up but what if he has? What if he's just ""over it""? You know that could be it. I'm all messed up. I should have stuck to the idea that he's too good for me. I told him from the beginning that I'm no good for him but he wouldn't listen. He just wanted what he couldn't have and now he has it he doesn't want it. Why? I'm mean  why do people function like this? I have to admit  I don't exclude myself from this terrible disease. But why? Why do people always want what they can't have? Because it's challenging. That's it.  I need some alone time. Some time to think things through. When I told him yesterday that the longer we are together the more scared I get  I did mean the more scared I get to lose him but as I was thinking today  I think I am scared. I don't know of what because I've been wanting this for so long now. After I got baptized  this just became more real than ever. This is it Antoinette. This is all for real. No joke. So what's so scary about that? I guess this is what they call cold feet. This is the time that the questions start rolling in. Do I really want to tie down so soon? Can I help make it work FOREVER? Will the love last FOREVER? Do I really love him? Does he really love me? Is this really love? Are these even questions you bring up in a deep  deep conversation? Am I being too emotional? I need some alone time. Some time to think things through because this is for real. No joke. I want to do the right thing because deep down inside my little heart  it sure feels like the right thing.

"  Here is my first ever post on this thing and I'm pretty excited.  I can post whatever I want on this thing.  I can talk about what I want  friends  family  loved ones  hated ones  pets.

"  Hmm  lol. Well  I cant really say that this is my first time writing a blog  I have done it before  but failed miserabley! :(  My other site that I was running and maintaining sorta died  when dot.tk decided to kick me off for not having like a gazillion visitors a month  OH  and because my account was free!! :P   Well  I better start writing about yesterday. Well  ( this is gonna be interesting :P) I worked from 4pm-9pm  and had like a 10 min break at about  8:25pm. Since I had to ride to work  coz my brother was being a wanker and didn't wanna drive me  i parked my bike around the back of the building  ( without a chain ) which i forgot. So at about 8:30pm I decided that i would check if my bike was still around the back of the building where i parked it. Well  to cut an EXTREMELY long story short  it wasn't and after alot of screaming  and alot of profanities being used  i ended up vending my anger into the nearest wall  which happened to be concrete. It would've been alot better if it had been marshmallow or something  otherwise I wouldn't have like a knuckle the size of Kansas at the moment now would I!? :D   After this  I went back inside  and worked the next 30 min till i finished. My Mum picked me up  and thought that since I rode to work  she would be picking up the bike aswell  but no! After an extremely heated discussion  ( more like we were ripping eachothers heads off ) we decided to go down to the police station  ( about 15 min drive awa ) and report the bike stolen. When we were reporting the details to the nice constable  he immediately jerked his head up and said "" oh  is this yours??"" I then had to walk down a long hallway  and he then revealed the bike  and to my joy  I replied "" yes  yes that is my bike ""  Since Mum had gone home to get changed  because when she picked me up she was in her SLIPPERS!!! We now had the smaller car  because Mum believed that we had no chance in the world of finding my bike!! We had to really cram my 21"" bike into the little family car!!  I went home and SLEPT!!! Well  toodles  I shall be back 2morrow  writing about my interested day!!  ( OH  and if your wondering were i work?? I work at Hungry Jacks  Junkfood Corner!!)BYE!! ",0
  You're the motherly type. You love to take care of the one you love  and generally you can be a bit overprotective and possessive  but you know  that isn't always such a bad thing. At least you'll be a good mom in the future.    urlLink   What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    the  sun  was great. i had  fun  at coney island.  i was  jealous  too.  he apologized. thats really sweet. but im an overprotective and possessive girl? -sigh-  my friends were mad cool. never seen the sophs had this much fun  together . one more time guys. you rock. ,0
  Loneliness dominates you. You can hide it well  but it's there  and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone  and need to do things to fill your time. You're afraid to tell people this  but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way  and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most.     urlLink   What Emotion Dominates you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    she came over today. i realized i missed spending afternoons with her. i guess its because i lost her for a while. maybe i needed that.  i have a motto:  paranoid bitches should go to hell.  because when you are  too many things go on in your mind. unnecessary stuff.   i am one of those bitches. ive been ignored. im being paranoid about it. its time to go to hell. ,0
  i just am. i miss him. so much. too much. im hyper cuz i miss him. probably. moms been mad cool. im thinkin somethins up. -sigh- its weird.   make it go away. i dont like this feeling. inferior? insecure? uncertain? i cant even tell what it is.  or i can just go back to being hyper.   yup. im hyper. ,0
  people are so full of themselves. sheesh.  everything in the world is  not  as bad as it seems. stop wallowing in self pity.  and yes  we do have a purpose for being alive. you would be able to see your purpose better if you stopped crying.  you have your two choices. [to be happy] or [to be pitied  because you are pitiful] .i.dont.think.you.need.anyone.to.choose.for.you.   sheesh ,0

  Tonight*  I was selfishly ditched for a pack of FM girls. I seriously thought that I had figured out who my true friends are  then I get ditched for someone like her. That's basically insane and it pisses me off a lot. I told Ashley about it and It's not like I can miss the game so I guess I'm going by myself. ::Gasp:: I never go anywhere by myself  so it'll be a learning experience. I got a letter from Eric today. :) The thought of him just makes me smile and giggle. I've been starting to wonder why people are starting crap about us  but then I think i've figured it out. Jealousy. I know Tiffany Engle wanted to jump his bones last week @ volleyball so that's probably where some of the stuff is coming from.   Friday  I have to pack for a long essential weekend with the girls. There's a party @ Samanthas then its off to the sleepover routine. I need to take a nap friday because heaven knows I'm always the first one out. Maybe not if I get to talk on the phone with Eric til odd hours of the morning. ::giggle:: So much fun.  Saturday Morning  We leave for Celina for a weekend full of 3 girls  a cabin  and probably no electricity. I will cradle my cell phone. I love to camp  don't get me wrong... but boredom kills. We'll be around Celina Saturday night so I was trying to plan something out w/ Angela to go to the bowling alley there or something. Eric said it was pretty cool... and eric knows everything. haha. I was just thinking... Eric hates FM.. and who ditched me today? FM kids.. And ditching Amy.. just IS NOT cool no matter what is going on. So I'll be gone all weekend w/ the girls. I will be home Sunday night probably. Then I have to live through another week till i get to see my baby. later on kids.. Amy ,0
  this weekend was hilarious  I can't believe i made it out alive. theres so much to tell and i dont have enough energy to type so i'll just type the main points...-- we ended up smelling like fish poop.. and we had sand in our panties.. YEAH! that is priceless.. how did we know? cuz it itched. haha. read my xanga for more gts'== www.xanga.com/asalways01 ,0
"  Where to begin?! The beginning would be good but I feel that jumping around keeps you on your toes more...jazz's things up a bit!  You are going to go on a strange trip  so grab a cocktail  sit back and buckle up...you are in for a long strange ride...YE-HAAAA!  First of all I must confess that I am the worst writer in the world  my grammar  punctuation and spelling are atrocious. It doesn't matter that there is spell check on this...it just don't matter! I am hopeless!!!!  I feel very old but I know I really am not. I am only 42  well I will be 43 soon. I am a single female  well not really single. I am in a relationship and have been for almost 6 years. My relationship is with another female who is 3 yrs. younger than me. What is age? Just a number. I don't look my age. I look maybe 5-6 yrs. younger than I am if not more on a really good day! Now my body feels like it is 143  which is a shame and that's a novel in itself.  I feel like I am such a failure and a disappointment to my mom  my partner and myself. I have some sisters  3 to be exact but it don't really matter  they aren't much better. I think of them as 3 peas in a pod all fighting for lead pea! I don't care what they think about me or my life style. I think I am disappointed in life myself...Is this it? Is this all I get? Well if it is I want a refund or I would even settle on an exchange! I know it isn't really fair to say ""IS THIS ALL I GET"" It is the cards I have been dealt  its no ones fault that I haven't done something with myself and my life  not anyones fault but my own. Have I been lazy? I think so. I also think some of it has to do with no encouragement in my younger years. I was really good at the artsy stuff in school. As a matter of fact the art classes are the only classes that I did good in and actually got a's...A+'S at that. As for all the other classes I was lucky to get D's. I had no interest in anything other than art when I was younger. Had I had encouragement who knows where I might be right now instead of here. But no matter what  how I have turned out  how my life is right now is my doing and no one else's. I could have pushed myself to go to school  to make better job choices and to do a bunch of things differently. I guess I blame myself. I have to.  Alrighty  this is it for now  tune in another time for more! ",0
"  I'm finally catching up with the computer generation  and have created a blog site--Wow!.  As far as I'm concern this is what I've been waiting for --a place to be ""Me"" and tell how the Cute Uke continues to survive.   Let's get going... Today was another cold day in North Dakota.  You'd think in June  late June that you'd be able to wear some fun summer clothing....but no it's 64 degrees  let me repeat 64 degrees  doesn't God know it's SUMMER in ND.  The state that never has consistent weather  so we wait for summer and drool over every warm day as if it's our last  and even more of a score is the day that the wind doesn't blow  thus today I got the double wammy no warmth and gee we'll throw the wind in just for fun.  It's really wearing on people's patience.  But enough wining from me.  I'm so glad Courtney turned me onto this  Lindsay has done it for ages but I hadn't seen her site; but tonight she's going to show me her's as well.  Okay here's the deal I'll do my best to blog on a regular basis  but I'm not going to force it.  When it's right it'll happen. Bye and Thanks for being here for me....you'll help I just know. ",0
  Let's try this again:)  Life is so wonderful  today I talked to my good friend Becky and she's here for a visit from Florida.  Lucky me!  We're going to get together on Monday night for a visit  and probably again Tuesday.  We've always had such a strong relationship  it doesn't matter how long between our visits they're always fun and she's so easy to be with.  She's a great MOM  and it's all she ever wanted was a family of her own.  Tonight another buddy is on his way to our home for a weekend visit  and tonight we're going out with friends.  Just trying to pack it all in before Mike and Courtney leave for AZ.  Every weekend is going to be full....full with family and friend time.  The biggest surprise is that today the weather actually cooperated  not gorgeous out but nicer than we had had lately. ,0
"  What more can I say than BOYS??? That should be enough right there. Okay listen to this wonderful story...I have been with this guy(Corey) for one year on May 30  2004 right...Well I thought that everything was just peachy between the two of us  but apparently I was totally wrong!! This guy whom I had previously liked had just broke up with his girlfriend of 9 months and I had went into his work shortly after their break up; well...Me and him got to talking and you know the kind of talk JUST good friends have right?? Anywhoo...A couple days later my brother invites him to the house to spend the night...I was totally cool with that b/c I had a boyfriend that I was totally content with. So he comes over that night and I was down stairs with my brothers and him watchin' a DVD and just relaxin' and then something unexpected happened...Matt(friend) told me that he had liked me for a long time now and was going to ask me out on a date but then I had started dating Corey(BF)!! So all that time that I had liked him and never thought that Matt(friend) would have gave me the time of day he LIKED me the WHOLE time!!!! OMG Now listen to this!! For a while now I had been thinking about breaking up with Corey(BF)b/c I hadn't really dated anybody else and me and Corey were starting to get REAL serious! And I wanted to experience other people first!! Well...I broke up with Corey on May 31  2004(the day after our one year anniversary)I know what you are thinkin' right LOSER!! Well I had to go with what my heart told me!! And it told me to set myself free for a little while! You know open to dating  talking with a guy and not feel guilty! But here's the bad thing...I love Corey with all my heart! It's not like I don't love him anymore I just needed a little break from the whole ""couple"" status! Now I am tryin' to date other people and I am leaving my options open to anyone who wants to date me!! But I can't stop thinking about Corey! Gosh i love him soo much! I need some help!!!!! PLease give me so opinions!!!!! ",0
  Today is June 25th and the first day for this blog for  urlLink ISTL ,0
  This is my blog to the world  that never blogged to me (apologies to Dickinson  check it out at www.bartleby.com).  What a fitting first posting to my blog!  Clever.  Blogs are the ultimate in one-way communication  brought to us by the infinite self-publishing capabilities of the web.  Children in Beijing and the editorial staff at Al Jazeera can find out with the click of a mouse what I have to say about anything.  Everything!  If it crosses my mind  it will cross theirs  yours  everybodys.  The good folks at the Independent School Technology Letter have come to yours truly  bloggingman  to get everybody hip to blogs.  Can do.  In fact  we decided to blog our way through the topic  for real.  Is there any other way to communicate?  From me to you.  I am giving Sherry and Will privileges to post to the blog as we go along  so they can help me keep it straight and blog it into shape.  What  you ask  is a blog?  Where you been?  If I spelled it blog  would that give you a clue?  Right  its short for web log.  Log: noun  a record of performance  events  or day-to-day activities (check it out at www.m-w.com)  and you know what web is.  Im keeping track of things in my log  which I publish on the web  hence this is my web log  or blog.    Of course  all blogs exist in the blogosphere.  Blogosphere (alternate: blogsphere) is the collective term encompassing all weblogs. Weblogs are heavily interconnected; bloggers read other blogs  link to them  and reference them in their own writing. Because of this  the interconnected blogs have grown their own culture (check it out at: en.wikipedia.org).    Blogs have become incredibly popular  even in schools  which is where I work (identity concealed).  In fact  a guy at NECC this year said you must blog.  If I must  So here I go.  Kinda catchy  you must blog it.  When a problem comes along  You must blog it  Before a thought sits out too long  You must blog it  When something's going wrong  You must blog it   now blog it  into shape  shape it up  get straight  go forward  move ahead  try to detect it  it's not too late  to blog it  blog it good   Thats the ticket!  Blog it good! ,0
  That's right  I've started a blog.  What led me to do this? Fucked if I know. Basically it gives me a way to take my anger out on the world in a civilised  punctual fucking manner.  I don't know what is to come next. ,0
  No  this isn't a post about some 'B' grade cock sucking yank movie.  So why haven't I posted much so far?  The Reason: Who the fuck knows about my blog apart from Evan?  Seriously  I have not told any of my school mates about this  or even what a blogger is  under the fear of being looked at as a weird uber person.  Apart from that  life is good :D ,0
  It's true  mobile phones are great devices.  I've had one since i was 13  plan of course  not shitty pre paid which Evan always complains about  and  I've always had a regular wage earning job to pay for my phone bill.  But why are phones so great? Because they are becoming more stable  smaller/bigger  better battery life and more reliable.  I change phones every now and again  having had the ever popular Nokia 3310 for 2.5 years  followed by a Sony Ericsson T610 for 8 months  an N-Gage (POS) for a month  a Nokia 7650 for a month (old  but top phone)  and currently  have a brand spanking new Sony Ericsson K700 in my possession which I've had for the last week  not even out here yet. Take a look at my precious:  http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_k700-692.php  New  small  super tankish battery life  and a whole load of features. And yes  I can control my mobile phone bill  but a phone is essential for me as I need to be picked up from all the places I go  unless otherwise catching public transport.  But  Evan is against the 90% or whatever it is of Australians that own and use a mobile phone. ,0
  It has  indeed  been a while since my last post on this site.  This is because I have been very busy  be it school  post office  baker's delight  goal umpiring  homework or gym  give or take a few hours sleep here and there.  Not much has changed  added gym to the routine  going well so far. Funds saving is at an all time low  but with the extra worked hours at the post office are quickly sky rocketing into buying stuff land. ,0
  This is my first entry  and I must say  this site looks MUCH better than livejournal.  For those of you who are reading this  my name is Meghan  and I am addicted to caffiene  video games and the internet.  Some of the sites I like to go to are:Gaia(my sn is Abbi Normal if you want to contact me)  Kingdom of Loathing(Ilove that RPG)  and The Best Page in the Universe(Maddox is god).  Not much is happening in my life at this moment  with summer vacation and all.  Ok  that was a lie...I'M GOING TO DISNEYLAND NEXT WEEEK! I'm so fucking excited.....   .....I've nothing else to add today. ,0
  I have started a Mel Brooks guild on gaia. So far it only has three members(including me) but what should I expect? Overall  so far so good.  The only prior experiance I've had with guilds(or any sort of online roleplay thing) is Neopets.  I remember starting out at Neopets....it was one of the last days of school during 6th grade...my friend Heather introduced it to me. I became instantly hooked to it(and so did anyone else I convinced to join  lol)  I wasted more than three years of my life there....and I've had at least six seperate accounts  on two diffrent e-mail adresses.(if you want one  PM me on gaia and we'll work out some sort of deal  I'm on a quest and I don't feel like giving anything away for free  lol)  Over time  things got a bit tedious and dull. For those of you reading this and are on Neopets  you know what I mean. You have to play their stupid flash games in order to gain neopoints(their currency) and I just don't have the patience for that anymore. Inflation  one of the negitive aspects of most economies  had gotten extremely high  so items became difficult to afford. So eventually  I just gave up. That  and I outgrew their whole 'kiddie' image.  Now about the guilds....I had created at least 10 or more guilds on that site  and the members almost always consisted of the friends in my seventh grade classes. Boy  I was glad they were around. Hell  I still talk to a couple of them on gaia.  ......wow this was long and pointless...perhaps I should continue with this tommorow  ne? ,0

"  I am a French born Hong-Kong guy. I have always wondered what my life could have been if I was not born here but there.   I have always wondered what would my life be if I grew up with people of ""my kind""  if people stopped asking about my origins and more about me.  I have just started a new job after a year where I have been mostly doing nothing but having fun  meeting people and having a heartache. Heartache ? Yes  I kind of left my heart in Hong-Kong the last time I went there in December 2003. I stayed there for a month and a half and found out I really enjoy the life there.   Really I do  even if it is harder to leave in Hong Kong than in Lyon (France). Even if work is tougher  even if I would spend more time commuting  even if I would have less money.  I think like I belong there  I don't read nor write Chinese but I speak Cantonese. I kind of feel alive there.  Is it because each time I have been there was on vacation ? Maybe. Now I want to try the real life there.  I have to stop hesitating.   Last time I was there  I attended a wedding. This time  I will also attend a wedding of very close relatives.  I often listen to a radio show from RTHK 2  Mak sir is on the mic and always says : Never give up ! From his point of view  anyone can start over from nothing any time in his life. I agree with him.  With everything I like about HK  why do I hesitate so much ? Am I affraid to leave my family ? Maybe. Am I affraid to fail my endeavour ? Maybe. Do I have th guts to do it ? Yes. Do I have money to do it ? Not quite.  I have to make up my mind in the next couple of months. ",0
"  For the last few days  I have had some interviews to work as a teacher in a new school still under construction.   I would love to do so. I am awaiting answer as for a second interview.    I think I can be able to do so. It's just that I don't know whether the girls I had contact with are serious or not. I told them about the salary I would like to have (the regular one for a foreign language teacher in HK) and I understand that it might not be possible.   I am already disppointed before the answer because I feel like it will be ""no"". ",0
"  Some days I feel so bloody old. It's the way I remenisce over old times and experiences I had when I was younger. And I think it's the fact that I do this so oftern is what makes me feel like a bit of a dinosaur. Maybe I'm being overly aware of the changes that have occurred over the last few years. I'm 26 and that's really nothing in the scheme of things. But I had such a crazy time from 16-22  23 that I can't help but sometimes feel in awe of the times I've had.  I imagine alot of us go through it but I seem to be the only who keeps talking about it.  I think I'm a narcissist. I think I think about what I think about way too much. Am I overly concerned with the way I perceive myself? Why do I always have to feel ""good"" about every situation. Even when I'm with a person  when we part I always feel the need to make the parting ""smooth and clean"".  No awkward goodbyes and whatnot. But then I think that because I'm already anticipating the situation that makes it awkward. Anybody else ever feel like that?  Why do I always have to find the things that I think are wrong with me and then make a strategy of how I""m going to combat and resolve those inequities? How good it would feel to say: I'm selfish  I smoke too much pot  I'm cheap  I always need things to be 'even'  AND THAT'S HOW I AM. DONE. No plan  no outline to correct my traits gone awry. I bet people live like that. It must be fucking great! And very freeing....  We took grandma out for lunch today to celebrate her 78th birthday. I wrote on her card: P.S. You don't look a day over 50!!  I thought it was rather clever and tongue in cheek for a variety of reasons. In fact I thought it funner to say 50 as opposed to 20 seeing as 20 is such a stretch it's not conceivable. Either way i don't think grandma got it. ""oh  we better not let anyone see this"" was her response. Shit  then I felt like an asshole and even when were at lunch I kept thinking about how uncool it was  and I couldn't shake the feeling that everything wasn't perfect and smooth. Aya.  Gram gave me a slew of goodies  and I've finally got something from the family to hold onto. Thank God ",0
  Hey all =) Just created this blog   urlLink blogger.com  seemed the most attractive one to use of them all  and you can see from my description that I'm trying to find a way to create a Flash based blog. This may take a while so I'll probably be using this blog for ages =)  There isn't gonna be any structure to my 'blogging' here  just random stuff I think up along the way.  It's kindof a p*ss take that I'm off on holoday tomorow morning for two weeks till the 14th of July so I won't be able to update it till then lol  but anyway  when I get back I'm sure I'll have loads of stories to bore ya with...  A bit about me  hrmmm. I love to do web design and graphic design  though I may not be all that good with it =) I've just started to get into vector images and animation  and you can see a small sneak peak to what I'm working on over at  urlLink timewaste.co.uk .

  So  I am doing this because I have been told by a friend I need to rant to the world  and I think he is right. Although  today is ok and I don't seem to have anything to rant about. Oh well  the day is young  I am sure that will change. ,0
  O  k  so you ever have those days where you just feel like shit? I am having a bad one today. My Grandmother is in the hospital dying and has been for the last few days. But because of my work I haven't been able to be there much. So  I went to work this morning and just felt horrible being there. It was actually making me ill. So  I left at lunch  and now I feel guilty about leaving. Oh well  I think a day will help me. I need some time to process things. And I will do a shift at the hospital tonight with my mom. I just really wish there was something I could do. I hate being helpless. Fuck  this sucks. ,0
  So  I just found out my grandmother died last night. Apparently people paged my at 2 am but I didn't hear it  so I just found out. So  why don't I feel anything? Is it because it was expected? I think she is in a better place now. She is no longer suffering  which makes me happy. And now I have to go to a wedding today. Not really what I feel like doing  but oh well. At least I will be with friends  and they will understand. And they will make sure I get nice and pissed tonight  which I think I need. ,0
  I am bored. I am bored. I am bored. I am bored. I am bored. I am bored. ,0
  So  Friday the 13. Hmmmmm. Either something good will happen or something bad will happen. Or maybe it will be like the rest of my life and nothing at all will happen. I have rediscovered why I don't stage manage any more. I am so bored watching this show. And I would feel bad about sitting there and reading. Grrrr. Well  only 4 more. And if one more actor comes to me with a brilliant idea  I am going to have to kill them. Maybe if they knew all there lines or all there songs or didn't goof things up every night  I would listen to them. But I wonder why they are worried about other peoples blocking  but don't seem to care that they have no idea what they are doing. ,0
"  I've heard about blogs quite a bit and finally decided to test the waters of putting one together.  I'll be curious to see if this changes my life any.  I'm sitting in my recently-painted TV room watching some show about ancient man-made things found off the island of Malta.  It's typical Science Channel stuff.  I love anything like that.  I'm also sitting in various chat rooms right now  but not really monitoring what is going on in them.  But if someone wants to chat me  that's cool.  I'll chat back -- maybe.  The TV room is now Ruby Red.  Or as a friend of mine called it -- ""Ho Red"".  It was a bitch to paint.  But I did it all myself.  It took one coat of primer and 4 coats of the red.  There is still minor color differentiation  but you can't really see it that much.  I'm probaby the only one that would notice them. ",0
  Watching the end of the Today show...  Monitoring my work email  but not aggressively working today.  I've pretty much checked out for the July 4th holiday.  I have a few things to do this week  but not a whole lot.  I could find lots of work to do  but without them having deadlines  I'm not too motivated.  Yesterday  the tile installers were supposed to come put in new flooring in my bathrooms.  They didn't show up.  They are supposed to be here today  but it's almost 10:00 am and they are still not here.  I'll give them till 10:15 before I call the company and see where they are.  I think they had to swing by Home Depot to pick up the supplies first  so I'll give them a little leeway.  I'm headed to the Pacific Northwest on Thursday night for some vacation.  Four nights in Seattle  then 3 in Vancouver  then 1 back in Seattle before flying back home to Dallas.  I'll spend some time in the city  but plan on getting out into the surrounding country as much as I can too.  I intend on exploring they Olympic peninsula  Mt. Ranier area  Victoria  and a few other places.  Plus a little city nightlife to divert my attention some.  OK  the tilers arrived just now...  so I'll keep my fingers crossed. ,0

  the month --june the day 29th... the hour...(not yet) ladies and gentlemen i invite you all to the biggest success story of all times....Errrr or maybe not as big but big enough to let my 6ft 3inch body frame seem pulverised  into as small a case as a case study.My wheatish comlexion seems to have improved not because of any bodily improvement but because of the dying signs of radiance...as they say radiance is brightest from a candle only when its almost exhausted. no never  i did not (right now iam knoding my head from left to right at the speed of light) expect a business school to be sooooooooo gruelling. PHEW! PHEW! PHEW!...oh sorry but those are the only sounds which i can expropriate out of my self...I CHOKE! CHOKE!.....to be contd.... ,0
  Sputter...sputter..Today TODAYYYY (he! Haw!)i for the first time in many days felt alive. today was the day when we in our business school got a business exercise.  to be brief the exercise involved our entire class to find such corporate executives in our city who were expatriates or executives of foreign origin and to ..Hold your breath .. Shadow them . which meant we would have to observe them going about doing their job. this whole exercise was to be completed in a span of 7 hours and also required us not to spend any money on any form of hired aomutation   which would now mean that we would have to go about the entire city (which means many corporates)..Hitch hiking.  with initial few hitches we all ultimately were off to our vaguely targetted destinations. i chose to go to the office of the Daimler Chrystler india situated at the farthest end off the city.i managed to reach the destination by hitch hiking  snd managing some how.aafrom then it was smooth sailing as i have my brother in law working with D.C. India . upon entering the office of D C India i was interoduced to two of the German executives on deputation from germany i had a 1 hour session with him as far as shadowing is concerned it was a complete no no with DC India as they said it was not a company policy to allow any such activity . all set and done by the end of it all i managed to reach my B school campus on time .    we then had a session with our teacher to discuss the procedings of the day . it was a wonderful learning experience and i would cherish this experience for times to come. ,0
  Ok  ok...all kidding aside  this is my first post to my Blogger!  Since I have other blogspaces online  I may not always put something here...but I may also duplicate or link posts between my different blogs  if I think they are important enough to spread around...  :)  Knightsabre ,0

  For the month of August  I have samples of my photography on display at The Coffee House in downtown Lincoln  NE. The majority of the prints are black & white  but there are a few color prints as well.  One thing  however...I stopped in yesterday (8-2-2004) to check things out  and noticed that my photos haven't been hung yet.  I am hoping this will be resolved soon...preferably this week.  If you stop in  you will be able to tell my work  as mine is all framed.  In any case  stop down and check it out  and have a great cup of coffee while you are wandering around!  Knightsabre ,0
"  Oh  how I love being sick...especially when it means missing work. This week  for instance...I come down with something earlier in the week  end up missing two days at work  and things just fall apart while I'm gone. This results in me having to play ""catch-up"" for at least the next week.  This isn't the first time this has happened  either. Not two months ago the same thing happened  and on top of everything else  I still had to go in to fix a problem that no-one else at work could.  On one hand  it's nice to be needed. On the other hand  I could REALLY use an assistant!  Oh  what do I do? I'm the lone LAN administrator/IS technician at my workplace.  Knightsabre ",0
"  It's official now!  I stopped back into The Coffee House  and my photography show is up!  If you are in Lincoln  NE  stop down and check it out!

  Well here it is June 30 and I'm sitting at work surfing the net trying to get things situated as I set out on my journey. I have spent the last month selling  buying and donating things so that I can be well prepared for my journey abroad. I have been checking my mail box day in and day out looking for my arrete de nom from the academie of CRTEIL so that I can hurry down to the Embassy to get my visa and all that jazz  but I wait patiently because each day my mail box is empty. I'm apparently very bored at work because I have time to create this blog  but it's nice to spend your last months doing things that you enjoy besides working. For now  I'll go and try to be productive at work and I'll be back soon!  Sam ,0
  Hey Guys   It's been a few days since I posted anything  but I have been consumed with French classes  packing  selling items  donating items and making plans to go home to see family before I leave. Yeah  I know it sounds like I'm an over-achiever  but I'm leaving in August and I have to be out of my current apartment by the end of the month. I'm still waiting for that damn academie to send me something so that I know they are trying to get things situated and such  but I wait in vain because my mailbox is empty every evening when I get home from a long day of work. I'm here at work now sitting  bored and sleepy hoping to get home to find my arrete so I can take off from work  drive to Houston and get my visa. Well that's as good as it gets for now  but I'd love to hear from some of you other people hanging around here and there. feel free to drop me a line or two or a nice  enchanted email. Catch you soon.  Sam ,0
"  I've been patient about the whole idea of waiting for paperwork  waiting for the schools to mail a piece of paper  but now I am ready to get this over and done with. I have packed up most of my things and I have tried to make arrangements to get things settled and I'm being held up by this piece of paper that says ""you'll be here"" I knew for sure that I'd have the arrete by now  but it seems that I've been merely living in a dream. Oh well for now i guess I'll just continue going day by day  waiting patiently.. ",0
  How the hell can they lose 3 games in a row to one of the worst teams in baseball.  They better get a new middle reliever and/or closer  or they won't be able to hold on to this lead.  If the Cubs make the playoffs or even worse the world series that would be an unforgivable tragedy. ,0
  Well I have been working on this damn thing for the last four months straight  no days off not even weekends  and the end is rapidly approaching.  Friday the 2nd I get to defend this damn thing.  Though my advisor keeps reassuring me I have nothing to worry about  I cant help but shake the feeling that something bad might happen.  Nothing would suck more than spending 3 years busting your ass in a lab  and then not get your masters (or more years and PhD  but thats not the case here). Maybe its just stress.  It may be the fact that I still haven't found a job yet.  Whatever it is  I can not wait to get this over with on Friday  spend the evening with friends  and then start planning for the rest of my life. ,0
  Well the defense went surprisingly well.  Few questions  my committee was nice  and it turns out I never had anything really to worry about.  Now I just have to find a friggin job.  Oh  and the cards reasserted themselves over crappy teams  by handing the Mariners their lunch in a brown paper bag. ,0
  Well now that Kerry selected a running mate  the election will start heating up.  My support goes towards are current and great President.  However  I am a little worried about his chances.  Everywhere I turn I hear how so many people hate him  he is constantly getting bashed everywhere you go  and for some reason other than talk shows the GOP isn't fighting back.  This was the same mistake his dad made  and I think this election is too important to lose to someone who has yet to take a stand on any of the major issues (Hey Kerry we know you wouldn't have sent troops  but we are there now so what would you do now if you were in office?) All I can tell people is to actually look at facts instead of read opinions  and at least make an informed decision. ,0
  Trying a new blog site.....http://roseysplace.blogdrive.com/ ,0
  Things I want to know:  1)  WTF is wrong with this place? 2)  Why do you continually piss me off each and every time I try to get to my blog? 3)  When am I going to find someplace else??  *grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr*  Not that I am not aggravated enough already today.  I'm so sleepy thanks to a certain someone who kept me up well past my bedtime last night (you know who you are :p).  Not that I'm *complaining* lol....but I am sleepy.  Going to bed RIGHT after I watch the Sox tonight.  Well  unless someone beans Eric Byrnes and gives him a concussion or some stiches.  Then I'll be up partying all night :D  God  I hate that man.  You do NOT shove Jason Varitek and expect not to make my list.  OMG.....my son has learned to swim.  Good GOD he surprised the SHIT out of me this weekend!  We went to my sister's down in Massachusetts for the 4th.  Last time I watched this kid try to swim was mid-June....he was getting it but not quite there.  He BLEW ME AWAY over the weekend. Jumped right into the over-his-head water and away he went  swimming from one side of the pool to the other....under water even.  If you know my kid....you know the whole underwater thing - HUGE deal.  **proud mommy**  I totally forgot the kid was due at summer school today too...he goes 5 weeks a summer to get help with his reading.  I don't think he needs it anymore (he really did last year but he is pretty much in the appropriate place at this point)  but if they are going to give it to him....I'm going to let them.  Extra help's never a bad thing lol...anywho  I totally forgot that he was supposed to start today and I never sent him....he's with his aunt all day at my nephew's track meet.  Prolly a good thing tho....seeing as I forgot to call the bus company and tell them where to pick him up ANYWAY lol  *sigh*  I'm rambling.  Whatever.  I'm at work and I am caught up and bored as shit.  I have a *huge* project to start that's not a big priority so of course....I don't want to do it lol.  I guess I should tho...they do pay me.  I think I'll check my email first tho....then maybe my messageboards....make a phone call....dammit  I really need a nap. ,0
"  an online journal sounds intriguing  if only to keep my thoughts in order. i have long ago given up writing in my journal due to the illegible scribble that is my long hand. the past few years would have made for some good reading and I will regret not having those thoughts to look back on. i suppose i have my memory but even that seems to be failing me in my old age or thru all the drama. drama isn't neccessarily negative but tonight i am wishing for a somewhat drama free past. tonight when i scan the postings of my name via the web  i come accross a memorial to him. someone in his High school class found out that he is dead and they are looking for stories in regards to their beloved fellow student. i sit here  at this desk and the air leaves my chest and isn't replaced for what seems like a great while. a connection to him. a connection to my soul. i miss him so much  i miss my husband  i miss nobles father. i miss sharing with him. laughing. i don't laugh so much anymore and i used to live for laughter. now when i do it seems empty and hollow. i feel fake when i am laughing. maybe the drugs will remedy that. maybe when i laugh again i will feel some connection. maybe this wonder drug will connect it all back in my brain again  but for now it seems all disconnected and although i have pretended that i have been on track for the past few years  i am a liar. my mantra has been ""it's OK"" well it fucking isn't ok  far from OK. i want to tell people that but when i do they run from me. i am always to be the STRONG woman. the strong LEADER. How imressed they all are by my resilliance. well guess what mother fuckers? it is fake. i am crumbling and you don't even know it or if you do  you don't care enough to say a thing. stay away and SUZY will pop back up like a wilted peace lily getting a much needed drink. i wish i could tell them that i am angry and that they too will understand my life when they watch their husbands die of cancer. watch as the man that you love dies while his baby grows in your belly. i was cheated. i was robbed and i have tried to make the best of it. i have waited for the best...it is alluding me. i just want some understanding  a strong shoulder to lay my head upon so that i can rest. i am tired of holding myself up. i am tired of running the show. i am exhausted and weary. where is my stamina in the form of a human?

  I have had it up to here! If you want to know what my life is like today  here it is in a nutshell: My name is Claire  I've just finished my GCSE exams (thank God!) I'm going to Oxford this weekend  and I am worried  stressed and pissed off simultaneously.  My brother Martin is a drug addict who has made my family's lives a living hell for the past 4 or 5 years. He is 15 in August. My parents are separated  and my dad has a heart condition. One more severe heart attack and he could die. Martin broke into my dad's neighbors house where they live in Aldridge  and now the police are looking for him.   They have just broken into my dad's house to search for him  and my dad's landlady has just called to tell him at work  so he's on his way home to do some damage control. I'm worried because my dad could get evicted as he is only renting the house  and he has worked really hard on doing it up so it will be a reasonable place to live in. He has been looking for a house for ages  but everything that seems to go right usually gets screwed up by my darling bastard little brother  so I don't know why I'm so surprised. At last count  my brother has been expelled from 3 schools and 1 college  and he hasn't attended school properly since he was about twelve.   There you have it. My fabulous life. I can't trust anyone completely in my life except for one person  who will not be named here. She is my rock to lean on  and I don't know what I'd do without her sometimes. I'm also annoyed because I don't trust any of my other friends enough to leave them in my room when they are staying over  because I think they will look for my private stuff. My songs  my stories... I have to hide everything private in my room every time they are there  and so even though people can read this I'm safe because none of my friends even know what a blog actually is. I know I sound like a melodramatic little whiner but this is seriously what my life is like. Between me and all my friends  we have enough problems to end up on Oprah or a similar show on a regular basis. This blog will be my way of telling our stories respectively. ,0
  does your boyfriend or girlfriend do something you hate? did you just get dumped in a really crappy way? do you have any thing to complain about when it comes to b/fs and g/fs? if u answer any of these question with a yes than i wanna hear about it. ,0
  ok what the hell is wrong with u when u r a geek and yet u can't help but have feelings for some1 totallyout of ur league? u see i really like alex but tasha likes him and britt likes him and alyssa likes him. all of which are far cooler than me so if ne one's out there give me one reason y alex would want to be more than just friends. ,0
"  it is so annoying b-ing me. at least evry1 else my age has one good thing in there life. bayfriends. to be perfectly honest i have had only one boyfriendin my lifetime. and even that only lasted 2 hours. i know i said that i've had more but i lied. mostly b-cause sandra and them were making fun of me cause of it. what is true tho is evrything else. and if ne of my friends read this ever im srry for lying its just the rest of u are so lucky cause unlike me u guys can easily get a boyfriend or a friend for that matter. out of all of us i was the only one that evry1 hated. while u guys are girlfriend matterial and friend worthy  i remaain here being as steph put it ""the friends friend."" thats y i think i may move to my dads if he'll let me. i dont want to be the friends friend anymore. that's what i was in orillia  barrie and even coldwater. im sick of people saying ""youre ashleys stepsister"" or yeah youre britt's friend.""or ""alexs friend"" or whoever's. i just wanna be me. maybe if i was me to begin with maybe alex G. would be into me or maybe i wouldn't be known by most orillians as little dion."" ",0
  i dont know if its me but it seems like whenever i don't see alex i really dont care. i start to think that there's no reason to actualy like him. i start to think that there's others like adrian or conor or someone else. but when i do see him its completely different i feel like there's noone else. but of course im just being stupid and tired. ,0
"  Id like to share a quote I particularly like:   	We find comfort among those who agree with us - growth among those who dont. 									- Frank A. Clark  How are we ever suppose to grow and learn if we are constantly surrounded by people who agree with us?  When you sit and discuss a topic with someone else who has an opposing view you will learn more from that one person than if you sat and discussed that same topic with 10 other people who believe what you do.  Although  I have found some very interesting conversations start up between people with the same views who are just pondering other possibilities.  I have a friend who is interested in the building sciences like I am  the two of us can get together and just bounce back ideas about what if this were to happen or if this one thing changed wouldnt that make a huge difference to the houses and buildings going up right now?  Its really cool to have someone on the same wavelength as you.  But  as far as growth goes  I feel I learn more by talking to someone about a topic that we are opposed on rather than have the same feelings.  When I come across a good conversation like this Ill try to remember to share it. ",0
  The city I work in  which feels and seems much more like a town  has a courthouse square downtown.  There is a big courthouse surrounded by a fair bit of grassy area with lots of trees  a beautiful little spot really.  It really adds to the whole town feeling.  All sorts of things happen in the town square: art festivals  performing art festivals  food & drink tasting  local merchant festival  and many more.    Well  one thing I've noticed since I started working downtown is that people (men mainly) like to take a mid-day nap in this courthouse square.  I lived outside of new Orleans before I moved here  so at first I thought these nappers were homeless people  untill I paid a little more attention to them.  The majority of these napping people are wearing clean  well kept clothes  and are clean-shaven.  In other words  they are just people who live/work around downtown who like a little afternoon nap.  They pick a tree  lay down  and just doze off for a little while.  I find that kind of interesting. ,0

  Ahhh... This is my first time writing a blog and I am happy that i am. What an interesting name. BLOG. I spent the night at my friends house and we had a lot of fun playing Counter- Strike. He's so happy that Im getting him an airsoft gun for his birthday.  I cant wait for my friend Mike to come back from piano camp.  I also cant believe that he got wasted up there in Stockton  CA. I need to do more exploring on this website. ,0
  UURRRGGG!!! I'm sooo sad. My mom said that we could possibly get a dog we saw on an adoption website. Then today when we were going to go see the puppy  she said that we didn't have enough money because Im getting braces soon. I wonder if Im being too selfish... hmmmm... My friend slept over last night and one thing that I realized about him is that he smells like a wet dirty dog EEEWWW. So many people want me to go to their houses for a fourth of July party. I cant decide which persons house to go to cause I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Decisions decisons..... ,0
  Wow. Today was a very hard day for me because I had to stop being friends with one of my best friends because it was an unhealthy friendship. But I'm glad that I did it. It took me a long time to realize that it was an unhealthy friendship because I was in denial.  But even my friends and family kept telling me that I need to break it off because it was affecting me in such a radical way. I will always remember him. ,0
  Today was a cool day because my family and I went to the beach and had a lot of fun.  We went boogie board for most of the day and then my step brother and I just swam in the water which I might add was really cold.  We were all sandy when we got in the car but my parents did not care.  Now Im worried that my dad know that im talking to the friend that I supposidly broke up with cause I was switching between windows and I think he saw the e mail but I know that I should not stress over it. Its my life and Ill deal with it how I want. ,0
"  Im Tessa. Im 16 years old. My little boy Ian is now 11 1/2 months. Everyday I look at him and am just amazed by how big he's getting. my life has changed so much since I had him. I mean who could believe that just over 2 years ago I was on my way to being in the ""popular crowd"". I was Miss Suzy High School. I hated it and I hated me. Prentending that I loved cheer. Don't get me wrong cheer is great just not for me. I don't have the patcience or the determination to give up that much time to one lousy sport.   I hated pretending that I loved hanging out with my boyfriend. I gave up all my friends for him. I loved him but I definitly missed my friends. Critter was so controlling. Always telling me who  what  where  and when. He let all his friends just walk all over me.    But that's changed. I got pregnant at the young age of 14. Critter didn't want to believe it. I was making it up supposedly to get him not to break up with me. Ya right! I loved him but I'm not that pathetic. I was too scared to tell my parents. So I waited until I was 5 1/2 months along. Too far along to keep hiding it. I don't think I've ever seen my parents so mad. They were convinced that I couldn't handle a baby so I'd give him up to my parents. My mom can't have any more children and she's always wanted another. But i knew differant  I knew i could handle a baby. I fought over every little thing with them. I was so stupid about the true rights for teen parents. I believe my parents when they said that I had to do with that baby what they wanted me to. So I let them talk me into giving Ian my stepdad's last name. Ian Matthew Kubitza. Everyday since they talked me into it I've regreted it more than you can imagine.    One thing that I was right about was that I could handle a baby. I'm the one who deals with temper tantrums  dirty diapers and late nights.  Don't get me wrong  without my mom I never could have made it this far. My mom watches Ian when I go to school and when I work. I still go to school full time and I'm going to start nursing next year through a program in my HS. I can't wait. I also have a part time job now. Granted it isn't the best but hey it's something!    My life is definitly better. I don't hate myself or my group any more. I do the things in school that I want not what looks cool. ",0
  to everone older and younger than i am  i would like to say that i am sorry for the way things will be. a lot of my peers are senseless  ignorant  angry  and belligirent. god forbid any generation raises a new generation that's not intelligent as they were well unfortunately this has happened. as i approach adulthood i look at my peers and wander how some of them could ever become productive members society  and how they ever could function as rational  inteligable adults. i see childlike outbursts of violence  lack of respect for others and athourity and an overall lack of concern for the future. very few of my peers have an intrest in anything that could help the development of our country or our society or themselves it's not cool. i fear that our parents will be left to control the country in their old age instead of their chidren.i think that our society will becom more corrupt andviolent as time progresses making the world a not such a great place to be. i fear that the next generation will be even worse  kids having kids is not cute it's stupid  and laughing when your or your teenagers baby does something wrong is not cute or funny  its even worse  it teaches your child to develop an unhealthy outlook to the behavior it will show to everyone as he/she grows up.to my peers learn to show a little respect  no mater how grownup you think you are shut up and listen  weall have a lot to learn. to the adults  i'm sorry that not all of us are great children  not the best generation yet  by far  also please don't try to defend your childs wrong behavior because you feel you are being personally attacked as a parent  it's o.k. to defend your parental beliefs  but be careful to check wether its your child or your pride you're defending  and also we don't really hate all of you we may be angry and do stupid things but we still love you parents/gaurdians.to the babies of my peers i am truly sorry  you will have a really hard life  your parents are probabally underprepared  and ignorant of how to raise a child.  everyone may not agree with what i've said  it was not intended to offend any of you  ut whats said is said  idf you think i'm wrong  then don't take it to heart. i may very well be wrong  i've still got a lot to learn. ,0
  well well well  i starting a new blog b/c im bored and my friend thought that this would be a good idea. But today was not a good day for me though. I was going to go watch a movie  Spiderman 2 today with friends  so got up around 8:30am today and started my cleaing early so i wouldn't have to worry about it later in the day and can get ready for the movies too. So i walked toward my room and this dumb crate was in my way and i stubbed my baby toe on the crate and part of my toe nail came off and i broke it  eerrr! It seems as though bad things only happen to me  oh well. But all day i was in freak'n pain and didn't think much about it untill the sharp pain started getting worse and worse through out the day. So now im on pain killers that are making me feel so weird and in a twilight zone it seems like  that i've been trying to sleep through out the whole day to get my mind off the pain. I even tried to watch BarberShop 2 which didn't work b/c my mind was defiantly on my pain. I thought that i can really take pain but i thought wrong lol. But i guess i'll get my booty to bed and sleep!! ,0
  Well today is fourth of July and my family is doing nothing but sitting st home and watching movies and eating a huge meal that my mom cooks like every weekend (its the Italian in her). But I'm hoping that we get this block party going thats going to happend in a few weeks  well actually next month probably  but i really want this party to happend b/c I'm gonna be turning 16 soon and want to have a tight party lol!! Well my mom called radio stations to help us with the party and everything and hoping that goes well too. It would have been a lot cooler if i got my licenses on my b-day too  if only i had a car though  hehe. I would go on a small road trip with my friends and not come back untill 2 weeks later (yea right my parents would kill me). Anyway  hope that everyone has a tight Fourth Of July  peace out! ,0
"  now im different! i mean  im not one of those ""xanga"" people...i dont dislike xanga  but i just dont like it...im not sure why  but probably cos all my friends have a blog from xanga. and i think its kind of weird... sorry if you are using xanga  dude  well well well  i hope cc (my gooody friend) is doing a good job. Kelpie (another nicccce friend) is leaving soon and there is gonna be a good bye party for her  which is supposed to be a big surprise...but cc already told me that things went wrong from the start...well  good luck guys! im here in japan  and im nothing to do with the party...lol (well i am  cos i was part of the planning  but i cant go anyways)  aww i miss my cat...hes so cute  so cute  and so cute. i can eat him. i mean i cant but i want...no  i dont want to  but if i try i can. sorry i dont make sence. but thats how awfully cute he is...  noow i have to spend my money....for kelpie :) since i cant come to the party  im gonna buy lots of nice things  may be lots of CHEAP things so i can buy even more  and give them to her when im back in europe. but the problem is that im not really allowed to go out alone...and my bike doesnt come off the stupid chain...so its not really possible to go in town and spend the nice money...  -------------i think its enough. so. okay. bye bye ",0
  i might have to go to the hospital and get the evil stupid injection on my arm....its not nice....:( i know its gonna break like three of my arms and the pain wont leave till i eat off all the arms...no  im not making sence.   yea and ive done pretty much nothing during the two weeks in japan  although i was going to have the best summer holiday ever  its the most boring summer holiday ive ever spent. its hot  it stinks. its hot  it sucks. its hot  it boers me. so its not nice.  i think im forgeting my english and its also not gooooood cuz i have to go back to school at the end of august and im supposed to be able to speak english like mad and get good grades on the work i do in english....oh well  ill say to my mom that i want to move to ESL so i can be with those stupid freaks from japan who think they are good at english and i actually can kill both of them...oops. the topic has kinda changed and i cant be bothered to look back and think what i was talking about. ,0
  Eww  that purple lettering wasn't the easiest to read  was it. Let's see how black looks. ,0
  Well for someone with an abundance of thoughts spilling out of her head  I'm having difficulty committing to writing them down. Maybe it's the heat  as we usually experience a much shorter summer . It's not as green and lush here as in previous summers. This global warming isn't just talk.      People are coming and going in my household. My youngest son Kevin has just returned from his week long summer camp. I was abit horrified to find that he had certainly packed along a visually controversial book for a christian based camp. I'm glad they didn't find it in his possession. They might've freaked out just looking at it  (Diablo  legacy of blood). He's almost fourteen and plays Diablo on the computer all the time. It looks like a skeletal grim reaper on the cover of it. Ahh  the joys of a young teenage boy. The sounds of his drumkit pounding on a summer's day  with our windows open for the neighbourhood to enjoy. The young teenage 'friend that is a girl' that comes to call  all giggles and cute.      My 'middle child'  Kimberly  now twenty and working hard is two weeks away from flying back east to start her third year of university in Toronto. The anguish she'll experience to leave her boyfriend behind  once again. Been there  done that  but what does a Mom know. I think she's got it made  with her girlfriend in a great apartment downtown Toronto. Two girls going to school and experiencing life in a big city. Wish I had that opportunity at that age. What's the rush for commitment? I don't know too many young guys with a game plan at twenty. And that is alright  so they take abit longer to figure it out. Why botch them up forcing them to make decisions concerning women at such a young age? But I am the Mom  what do I know about such things. Hmmm.      I have one more 'child'. At this age  my least stressful one. Trevor  he's twenty-two. He's working full time  does apprenticeship training six weeks out of the year  he's doing OK  not too much to worry about there. He's a happy guy. His PIA days were when he was about 14- 16. He's got a very nice girlfriend  keeps him in line.      Well maybe I'll stop there for today.My real stresses are in the toothful tales of working in my dental office. I'll save that for another day.... ,0
  Ok...This gonna be a long story. There were a couple in the XXX school. They were both secondary 2 at that time. They loved each others deeply. The girl shall be named Yi. The boy shall be named Le. They would sms each others telling how much they love each others everyday. They will greet each other morning and bla bla bla~  Yi does not treat Le very well but Le love her deeply. He would shower her with presents occasionally. On Le birthday   Yi does not give any Le any birthday presents. Le was upset at that time. He heard from Yi's friend that she will be giving Le presents but in the end it was just for air. Le was very understanding. He thought that Yi might be having some cash flow problems as both of them are teenagers. On that day   although Yi had nothing for Le   he was still happy when his good friends help him celebrated and others wishing him.  Since then   Yi's friends will to say to Le that Yi is not treating him as her stead. But Le didn't mind at all. Le is still a happy boy with her.  Things start to crack. Le was calling her friends and asking why Yi didn't treat him so good like other couple do. Soon   more and more people were joining in the conference. Some encourage Le to break with Yi. On that night   Le break with Yi.  Yi was very upset as she don't know why Le break with her. Le was upset at that time too. So he decided to join gang to ease his suffering. Le still love Yi that time but just don't have guts to patch with her.  When Yi birthday was coming   Le decided to go to city hall saint andrew church to pick some ' love seeds ' and put it into a bottle and give to Yi on her birthday. On Yi birthday   he wrote some notes telling Yi how much he still love her and he wanted to patch with Yi. He stuff the notes into the bottle of ' love seeds ' and told Yi's friend to give it to her as he got no guts to give.  Despite how hard Le pick the seeds   Yi refuse to patch with Le and she had stead with another guy call Yuan.         After around 1 year   when they were both secondary 3 in the same class. Le got news that Yuan break with Yi. Yuan and Yi were together for 9 months. Le wanted to patch with Yi.  To be continued... ,0
  Yeah  so today I wasted sitting around doing nothing  but wishing that I could do other things. I should stop sitting around not doing anything about it  but I don't know. Maybe this right now is just pms I don't know haha. I wish that whole deal with Brendan never happened. I really liked him alot  and as much as we all say this  he was different. He is different  I swear it. I was so so upset when he said we couldn't be together  but I didn't tell him. maybe I should have. I didn't want to put more on his shoulders though  so maybe i did the right thing? Either way  now for some reason he's upset  though he doesn't tel me anything anymore. so I don't know  maybe him and amanda got in a fight. Maybe his dads being stupid. Oh well. Moving on..  Justin pissed me off today  well kind of. Originally i was going to take a day off of work on the 12th to go to ozzfest with him. Now he was whinning about a hurt ankle  I told him take some painkillers get a brace and lets go. The he made the excuse of his mom was being dumb about it. He's just a talker i think  but then again I am too. I try not to be  but its just how things go sometimes I guess. I need to work on that.  I feel so sick right now  all because of the stupid period. Rawr guys should have to go through this. Then again I don't have to worry about boners or blue balls or any of that guy stuff. So I guess its all good.  Another 3rd of July that I won't be doing anything for. Darn. Oh well next year should be good  maybe charles  his friend and i will all end up throwing a party. If that actually happens where I'd move in with him. Who knows  I've got plenty of time to plan anyways.  I hate stupid drama. Especially people who just start it cause they want something to talk about and look cool with. so so stupid. Then again I don't know. maybe i do to..I hope not hah. Oh well.  blah I'm going to go take a shower and figure out something to do hopefully.  End ,0

"  My son's name is Tiger and he has Autism. He is almost 6. He is brilliant  beautiful  sweet  and yet no one out in the world sees that. They see a kid who can't talk  and who squeals alot  especially if he is upset. He has a lot of communication problems  but he has progressed so far since we found out he had a problem to begin with.  There are alot of people who have children with Autism in Plano TX. I haven't really met anyone who has one like mine. Maybe I am not looking hard enough. I have a 14 yr old step daughter  a 12 yr old daughter  an 8 year old son  Tiger  and a 4 yr old girl. My husband works night. I stay home alot. Its hard to get out and work. Next year when my 4 yr old is in school I may be able to work.   I have always had trouble getting out and meeting people. I am a real homebody and I think my kids hate that. Its very very hard to go out when its just me and the kids. Tiger is loud and strong and loves to run away from me. I love my son to death but some people's reactions to him are hard for me to deal with. Outings with him leave me feeling frustrated that we can't seem to do ""normal"" family activities. ",0
  After 2 days in a row of getting my son on the school bus late  I realize something. The alarm clock in the bedroom is 30 minutes off from regular time! 30 minutes late.And who would do something so phenonimally stupid? My husband would. See...he works nights. So he gets up in the afternoon. But does he tell me he's done this to MY clock? NO. When I call him to ask him if he did this(which I already know he did)does he apologize? NO. He never apologizes. My angry response negates an apology. See...things are always about him. Screw what the rest of us need. He set that clock to HIS work time. Never mind that he never needs it to wake up. I wake him up  or the kids wake him up.   Ever been so pissed you can't go back to sleep even though you are dead tired? ,0
"  Why  hello there. Is it normally this difficult to start one of these things? I'm trying not to plunge into a sea of various results of hallucinogenics straight away  so instead I'm going to approach the problem of how I'm going to start this thing off... But I guess I already have !! Well  that was easy !!  I suppose I should introduce myself. Hi  I'm Laura. *shakes hand* I'm thirteen  and I live in a large town (or small city. But hey  the glass is half full) called Livingston  which is in Scotland  located near the capital. I was born on the 29th of September 1990  which makes me a Libra (the most utterly boring sign in the zodiac).  I go to a Catholic high school (St. Margarets R.C. Academy) which I like to refer to as ""The Convent."" I am  in fact  a baptised Catholic  although I wouldn't say that was my religion as I don't practice it (unless that couple of times that I picked up the Bible when I was in a 'contradicting everyone' mood counts...). Actually  you could say that me and God have some issues to work out. I suppose you could call me an Atheist  although I did mess about with Magik for a while...  This is like my seventh attempt at a diary  as I just seem to start them  get bored and then move on to start another one. But  as you are my diary  you are required to have a name (See? At least the Diary of Anne Frank inspired me in SOME way).  And you shall be called... Tai. I like that name  I got it off of Rhyan  who wants me to me called Tai when I become a transexual. Personally I'd rather be named Bert. That's a masculine name. I tried to look up Tai on a names and meanings website  to enlighten myself onh the wisdom behind it. This is my result:  Name: Tai Origin: Chinese Meaning: 'Very big'  ...That'll do me. *wink*  Hum. Isn't it ironic how I have just spent about an hour setting up this account and fixing my profile to look all nice  and when I start writing my first ever entry... I get writers block. Oh  speaking of irony  my friend Sian and I were in Bathgate on Monday  and as we were walking to the chippie an NHS van drove past us... and the driver was smoking.   ...Well this seems like a sufficient introduction  so I'm away laughing on a fast camel.  Entry Closed ",0
  Fourth of July: It was kinda boring for me. A few of Rachel's friends came over and we shot off some big fireworks that my daddy bought. It was alright I guess. Wow  okay now onto these last 2 days. I had to wake up at 5:30 in the morning on Monday to get ready to go to my Grandparents' house(which is in Branson--4 hours away). On the way we got McDonald's breakfast(because that's the only meal they can make that is good enough to choke down.) We got to their house at around noon. We came in and talked for a little bit  then we watched the tape of my promotion and from dance camp. Then we sat. And talked. And sat. And ate. And sat. Then my dad and grandpa went outside to unload firewood and they forced me to help them. Okay  I'm not the type of girl that goes out in the woods and loads firewood into a 30 year old Ford truck  but I did it just because I'd rather do that than sit inside and talk to my grandma  lol. When we were unloading it onto the stack of firewood that was already there  I got bit by an ant. It hurt like hell  so I went inside to put aloe vera on it. I checked my phone and saw that Kierston had called me  so I called her back. We ended up talking for the next half hour until my family came back inside and then we ate spaghetti for lunch. After lunch  Rachel and me went outside and rode the four-wheeler for a little while. Then I came back inside and called Cam and we talked until he had to go to baseball. We ate mac and cheese for dinner and then we watched TV for a little bit. Then I called Kier again cause I was bored and we talked for a little while. Then I came inside again and got ready for bed. I figured I should go to bed early since old people wake up early. The next day  my dad came in and woke me up at 9. I was soo mad. So I got up and ate breakfast  then went back to sleep till about noon or 1. My phone was dead  so I couldn't call anyone  unfortunately. We talked again for like an hour or whatever and then we left. On the way home we stopped by IHOP and I got some chocolate chip pancakes. And we got home late last night and I got on AOL  watched TV  the usual. Went to bed at like 3  woke up today at 12. Today Colton came over to see Rachel. They went swimming and she's taking him home right now. I'm sitting here bored out of my mind typing the longest thing I think I've ever typed in my life. Later... ,0
  Of course the first week went by... not juz wnet by but with events that made me realised that teaching is no longer teaching.  Firstly  34 periods as a begining teacher. Really heavy. More than double when compared to my practicum dayz. But i took it in a good stride. I took it more of a challenge and I have to live up to it.  What I am even more surprised is that  I have to work more than 15 hrs a day. Is this crasy or what. The first week  the only day that I managed to leave sch early was on fri  which was to go for fridy prayers. This is because on the 30 and 1 of July  there were induction programmes for the new teahcers. Thus I was not able to prepare lessons for my coming day and I have to continue work at work at home till 12in night. This cycle stated on tues 29 of june where the teahcers had a contact time. Thus my work load on tues was carried on to wed and wed to thurs and thurs to fri. I feel unfair to my students because I personally think I could have prepared a more interesting lessons for them.  But then again when i think abt it  the induction programme could have been carried out much ealier or during the holidays when we came back for the workshop where the entire induction programme could be squeeze into one day.  While  I enjoyed my classes. I love to go to class and present my lessons and see the kids literally grwo in terms of their knowlege and moral development. Thus I realised why there is a high percentage of teachers leaveing the work force because teaching is no longer teaching. There are lots of admin stuff which begining teacher like me have to managed.   Fortunately I have a very helpful department which keep in me check with the stuff that is going ard in the school  like booking of the AVA room or the computer lab. Despite all the heavy first week  I look many new things which have kept my teahcing passion alive. One of them is the love for the students. Seeing the ability to see them grow is something I feel no amount of money can buy.  I guess i need more time to get mysekf acustome to the sch policy and work culture. We see how it goes in the second week then. Till then.. signing out wery and still hopeful.....  Begining Teacher in AMKSS ,0
  It is around 2:00 a.m. and I am just sitting here on the couch with my dog  who is asleep  watching a little Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  Debating on whether to go to sleep or shoot off a firecracker or 2.  Haven't decided on what to do.  Husband is at work and we need to decide on a house to buy.  Decisions and so many other things to do... ,0
  Today Jay and I went and looked at a few houses.  The one I liked the most was temporarily taken off the market  but anyway.  We found 2 more that had potential in them.  In the mean time we are still on the look out for the right house.  I am now free of paying off my car because today I made the final payment.  YEAH!!! YEAH!! YEAH!! It is about time  5 years seems to long.  Anyway  it is raining right now and I am on the last chapter of my book.  Can't wait to finish it to start on my other 2.  Until the next post. ,0
  The other day Jay and I went with a few of his friends to celebrate our birthdays.  Some of us had fun at On the Border.  Then we went to see Anchorman.  About the only part of the movie that I liked was the soundtrack.  My husband doesn't understand my sense of humor.  Yes of course there were parts of the movie that were funny  but other than that I didn't like it that much.  I am just not that big of Will Ferrell fan.  Big woop on seeing him chest exposed.  It looks like he permed his chest hair to get it that curly.  I would have rather seen the Terminal or Chronicles of Riddick. Ohhh Well.  A girl can dream. ,0
  While my husband is laying comfy in our bed I went to a  board that he frequents a lot.  As I was looking for some threads to post in I found a couple of disturbing ones that he had posted in.  Needless to say  I don't feel very wifely or womanly after seeing what he had posted.  I actually cried.  It makes me feel like he doesn't want me anymore even though I know that is not the case.  I just can't believe that he posted it and all that crap.  I don't know what to do or feel right now. I don't know whether to be angery or ball my eyes out. ,0
"  I think I first heard about ""blogs"" about a year ago. I'm sure at the time I swore I'd never have one  now here I am. A suggestion from a good friend and I steped right up...me and myself might have something to say about what ""I"" have done.   A year ago things were simpler. I had no idea what I was in store for. Getting laid-off  going back to school  losing people I never thought I'd see walk away. On the other hand I guess I didn't think I'd get to see my parents again for the first time in 5 years. I probably have more mixed feelings about that than anything...but I'll save that for another post...  So here I am. Somehow the world feels smaller every year. I feel like the boundaries society places on our minds through work and school has shrunk my mind and locked it up...I didn't feel this way a year ago...as if every year this world pushes us all one step closer to accepting the bull shit as normal...  I'm not normal...now I'm a blogger ",0
  ahhh  finally I've got a day off today from the joke I spend 60 hours a week at called work. I'm in the process of sending out resumes...again...  I really hate that I can't seem to find anything more than a dead end job. Finding a career isn't what I want either...but I need something that pays well enough for me to be able to live. Maybe I should just join a band that needs a good guitarist and cash in...but the problem is I like a lot of what's out there  but I certaniy don't want to play it...lol. It's too much like selling your soul to me.   I'm so stuborn...but it's got to happen on my terms in order for me to be able to live with myself...lol. It helps though that I'm going ahead in the right direction  even if it feels like it's taking forever.  That said  tonight I'm fixed on making some magic happen...I don't even know how yet..all I know is I'm going into the studio and it's going to come through.    Someday it's going to be to a point where I'm going to not be able to justify the waste of time my job is...and I'm going to be consumed by this thing we call music...I just hope by that point I've at least got a band together so I can play it...lol... ,0
  Apr. 22nd Sorry for disappearing for a whole month! The journey was great  you can easily tell from the pictures i added in my album. Now i'm back  fully recharged from this long pleasant break!  Maybe it's a rhythm i adopted from the repeating semester-vacation-semester pattern over time  emptiness usually creeps on me when i've been too long away from my school work (good or bad?). Now getting back to what i was doing feels super-good (don't give me the diagnosis of workaholic^^)  especially with the freshness of the long sleep nights still left in my brain.  Mar 11th  I got a new camera!!^o^ The days were so hard when the great sceneries are lying there and you just cannot take them home. You won't wait long to see the best sights in Bangor!! :-)  It's now tow weeks away from easter vacation. I'm already counting the days! guess it's the same for those of  you who are in UK^^ what are you guys planning to do for this long spring break? I'm going on a trip to Scotland and fly from Edinburgh to Netherlands (again^^).  Engjoy the warmth of early spring! I'm sure you will all make the best out of your time!   Feb 29th  after over one week's  construction  this page is roughly finished. It's my first attempt to build a homepage. With the foolproof tools from Yahoo  things seem to go on well^^  Spring still feels afar  It snowed for two days  leaving Bangor covered with pure white. The land shines brightly under the sun  and the colour of sky turned from the dead grey to a clear blue  with just enough trouches of clouds. It would be a perfect sunday if i don't have to sit indoor and work out my statistics assignment...    Feb 21st  I started building this page...  Since one and half years ago  my life started to float and i've been moving from one place to another. The new places fed my curiosity and brought freshness into my life. Yet friends come and go  it's indeed too hard to keep close friends close when we are all busy moving on in our lives.  It's not until recently  when i was talking with an old friend  did i realized how little i have been sharing my life with my friends. Let this page be an encouraging start. Do come and sit for a while when you miss  your dear friend! ,0
"  I was in a really really good mood. i even offered to stay 3 extra hours at work. i do that all the time. they ask me to stay and the nice person i am i do. I dont want to anymore. im tired of being treated like a lesser person then them its not fair. i didnt do anything. i do my job and im nice to them. but some of them just treat me like im a inferior person. im so tired of that  everyone thinks there better then me. my manager would yell at me at anything i asked. or give me looks of hate. i asked for my break and she got all mad. then 2 minutes before the time i said id stay tell i asked who was taking my place i got yelled at in front of everyone ""you still have 2 minutes and ill put someone back there so get back there!"" then she turns and continues to talk to her friend that had come in  and becca gave me snide remarks and laughed. im sorry  i do recall that i was supposed to get off 3 hours prior to this but i stayed for you bitch. its like they enjoy humiliating me. beccas always saying things like ""no one cares what you think or say"" i hate my job. they made me cry. i hate them ",0

  By  Sixpence None the Richer      I'm going nowhere and I'm going to take my time    All the questions in the world I can leave in my mind    I'm waiting on the sunshine  the sunshine       I'm waiting for answers  I'm waiting to figure it out  I trip on my chances  I slip through my doubt    I'm going nowhere and I'm going to take my time    all the questions in the world I can leave in my mind    I'm waiting on the sunshine  the sunshine the sunshine        well it seems that my weakness  is sometimes my only strength  and in my incompleteness  you get your way    I'll be around   and I will find my way back down  and I'll see the sound of the sun     I'm going nowhere and I'm going to take my time    all the questions in the world I can leave in my mind    I'm waiting on the sunshine  the sunshine        the sunshine ,0
  Wow. I can't believe how fast the summer's gone by. But WAIT! It's NOT over yet!! You know  if I was in school right now  the next 2 weeks and 1/2 would be a really long vacation. So I have to keep thinking that way. Not  School's almost here   but  2&1/2 week Holiday.  Hey  that's longer than Christmas break. I'm not too anxious or whatever about starting again  it's just the same old  same old to me. I always like to get new clothes! That's the fun part  of course. Everyone is so scared about seeing people again. It's only been 3 months! Not three years! And like  who really cares what ppl think about you. So I don't look totally different.~ So what? I've given up on the whole must-try-harder-to-improve-my-look craze  I just wear what I like  ; have my hair and make-up the way I want it. I remember in 8th grade I would wake up at a quarter to 6 sometimes so I could get my face and hair just right. Now I wake up at 6:30  and spend a 30 minutes on all of that. (mostly because it's early and it takes forever to wake up) Anyway  I'm rambling.. as usual. ,0
  Linkin Park - Somewhere I Belong by Linkin Park   (When this began) I had nothing to say and I get lost in the nothingness inside of me  (I was confused) And I let it all out to find  That I'm not the only person with these things in mind (Inside of me)But  all that they can see the words revealed Is the only real thing that I got left to feel (Nothing to do)Just stuck hollow and alone And the fault is my own  And the fault is my own...  Chorus I want to heal  I want to feel  What I thought was never real I want to let go of the pain I've felt so long  (Erase all the pain until it's gone) I want to heal  I want to feel  Like I'm close to something real  I want to find something I've wanted all along Somewhere I Belong... And I've got nothing to say  I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face  (I was confused) Look at everywhere only to find That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind  (So what am I) What do I have but negativity Because I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me (Nothing to lose)Nothing to gain I'm hollow and alone And the fault is my own  And the fault is my own... Chorus  I want to heal  I want to feel  What I thought was never real  I want to let go of the pain I've felt so long (Erase all the pain until it's gone) I want to heal  I want to feel  Like I'm close to something real  I want to find something I've wanted all along  Somewhere I Belong... I will never know myself until I do this on my own And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed I will never be anything until I break away from me I will break away  I'll find myself today... Chorus (repeat until end)  I want to heal  I want to feel  What I thought was never real  I want to let go of the pain I've felt so long (Erase all the pain until it's gone) I want to heal  I want to feel  Like I'm close to something real  I want to find something I've wanted all along  Somewhere I Belong... ,0
  urlLink Come  Now Is the Time To Worship (Brian Doerksen) - Vineyard Music Discography    When I read the words part of me still says 'How corny...' and then I blush because this particular song on the cd I was given has gotten me through the past few days.  When I hear it it is like a call to the mountainside at sunrise.  I feel a heartbeat and it makes me feel a little more alive. It has intensified my prayer  and surely that can't be a bad thing? ,0
  This is your Mother speaking :  Is he a Giant?  To you he must be at 6ft4.  To me he is equal (and I am 5ft 2 and a bit).  To your 8 your old eyes he is sunshine that makes us laugh. Is that why you started calling him Mr Sunshine all those years ago?  That is Good  this 44 year old Mom is NOT going to destroy the immage...  I hope he answers your funny marvellous little writings. Maybe he doesn't realise the effort you put into them.  With Love and Lob Ya  Mom xxx ,0
  Elizabeth and I took a tube from Morden to Aldgate East. Had a marvelous vergetable curry with the most fragrant rice I have ever had.  Not bad for 8 quid for both of us. Now this was like entering a foreign country.  In the middle of London and even THE GRAFITTI WAS IN ARABIC.  Wow.... Birgitte joined us after several calls on cell phones : Where are you....I can't SEE you  (well no  we we trying on shoes INSIDE a shop).  Shopper Unanimous reunited.  I was soooo proud of myself  walked through a whole market and entered three shops without getting out credit cards or cash.  Nothing I fancied  that helped.  Instead I spend my birthday money on my friends.  Found the Graduate Art exhibition spread out over the whole old Truman Brewery site.  Fantastic stuff there.  Goldsmith was easy to find (thank you Adam for telling me they would be there).  One particular college we found by mistake got 1st prize from me : one guy had build a totally pointless contraption and when I asked him WHY he answered 'Cos is it pointless'.  I LOVE IT.  He  now wants to add on to it but can't because he has run out of space at home.  Ultimate stress beater.    Never found the Surrey lot :-(  Definitely going to the next one.  Legs are knackered  tomorrow I will pay the very very painful price.  Was it worth it...oh yes.  God bless.  J ,0
  I don't entirely know why I've changed 'blogs'. I used to be at diaryland.com but decided to change  as things are starting afresh.   The summer's here. Gah. Lots of thoughts swirling in my head. Waiting for other friends to officially finish their colleges etc so that the summer can commence  big time . Well  almost  I hope.   After the summer I start life in performing arts school. I'll be studying Theatre and most likely English Literature. There is no way on earth I thought I'd be sat here a year ago  winning a place in Britain's only free performing arts school. Strange. This will probably become home to future posts in the summer  and when I start school.   Things are about to change. ,0
  Christ. This weekend kinda epitomised what my summer will be like. I don't think B wants to know me any longer  after no pickups and four calls... I don't think I'm on the top of peoples lists right now. When the others get on their school break  they're off to Poland which shall leave me here  back to square one. But  so I hope  when they return a real summer shall commence. [I can only keep my fingers crossed so much]. V gets back from work this evening  but I doubt I'll be seeing him if he gets back in the early hours. I guess next week will be spent in a coffee shop  drinking soft drinks and a cigarette in one hand - as per...  I don't know why I have such  great expectations of the Summer. I think it all stems from the Green days - when I was Mr. Popular. Well  so it seemed. Then that faded out and I was left with another lot of people...now im just hoping that doesn't fade out. I don't think it will.  But  there is a new prospect ahead of me  a'course. New school  new people  new faces  new opportunites blah x 3. Things are going to be new  and  perhaps my past will fade out  but there's something ahead afterwards. How mnelodramatic. Today  I shall do nothing. Its 2:25 pm and im in my duvet undressed at the pc. Dad's currently at the Tour de France in a smaller championship - we all pray he doesn't fall off a mountain. lol.   ...I had the sudden urge yesterday to watch willow. I must buy it.  P ,0
  hey this is my first time using this...i don't really have much to say...today has been a boring day...my mom went grocery shopping and they didn't have chocolate chip bagels...i made choc. chip cookies but w/out the choc. chips...they are still really good...well thats about it...ella is going to her nana's lake and cabin till sun. so i won't be able to talk to her...well i gotta go bye ,0

"  My name is Crystal  My life story is not all that good. You may not like what I say. My father left me when I was 7. After that my mom found a boyfriend named Jim. My mom and dad are still married to this day. Still to this day there is fighting . When I was 13 my dad called and started telling me what to do with my life. But I told him off and said ""you was not in my life so don't try to tell me what to do"". When I was 14 I lost my virgenity to an asshole I thought I had it all untill some slut came around. When I was 15 I fell in love with an asshole again  He gave me a ring on my birth day. I did not know I was being treated by my boyfriend at the time. I was being treated like a dog. In my life I feel like I lose everything I have ever loved. Most of my family think I'm not ready for the world but I know I am. I'm sorry to my family for doing bad things  I'm sorry to my best friends for being for telling the truth. Some people don't like the truth most people don't Like me because I tell the truth.  Most people think I'm just like all the outher girls but as you can see I'm not. I'm just lost and crazy in this world. I feel like I don't belong in this world and know where to go. So I'm thanking my boyfriend for helping me trust again and I love him. I have two sisters ones name is Carolann I love her so much but she don't think that I am smart. She thinks I am going to fuck up my life just like she did. My sister Jill lives far away from me and she is lost and confused I have nothing nice to say about her. I have one brother named Garold but hes gay. Most peolp think that I am a slut but I know the truth thats all I need and if I was a slut you would know it. Just because I got the body to be a slut dones not make me one. And just because I had two boyfriends live with me does not mean I am a slut I was just looking for the guy that I am with now.  And just because I hate geting up for school does not mean I am going quit. And just because I don't talk to you for a week does not mean I am out going to fuck up my life.   ~Thank you for reading this~   Crystal Leeman ",0
  I feel like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz!  Except that instead of a tornado  the State Department has come to disrupt my life.    My background:My mother was an OMS for many years and retired in 2002. I never lived with her overseas but the kids and I did get to visit Addis  Dhahran  Riyadh  Barbados. She was always after me to take the FSWE so I did twice in the early 90's.  I didn't pass either time so I thought it wasn't meant to be. I became the teacher I always dreamed of being.   Well  life changes.  My oldest son was in college and after 9/11  he decided he wanted to make a difference and following grandma's lead  he wanted to join the FS.  He wanted me to take the FSWE with him for moral support.  Guess who passed?  Me.  I went to orals the first time in Nov and only scored a 5.1.  My son and I  along with another son had already signed up to take the FSWE again.  Guess who passed this time?  Me  again.  This time I did orals in July and received a 5.9.  Took forever to get my clearances through but then I made the register.  I was offered the June A-100 class but had the last class of my master's to finish so I declined. They then offered me September.    Did I really want to do this?  That has been the million dollar question! Or in the case of the FS  maybe the hundred dollar question. Do I want to leave my kids  have my husband leave his career  just to try something I may not like?  I have gone forward and taken all the steps but I still have days of doubt.  I have my first grandbaby coming on July 22.  How will I like leaving her?  My other son graduates from college in May  will I be here for it?  Another son is getting married in the spring.  How could I miss that?  No guarantees I will still be in the states.  What if I don't like being gone from everyone?  What if I miss teaching? What if I can't stand working in a visa mill?  Is everyone else in the 121st having these doubts?  I sent in all my paperwork on Friday.  I guess that makes it official. Time to get back to sorting 10 years of accumulated junk. At least my house is getting clean! ,0
  Isn't that nice? Well  I'll post here whenever possible (if there is something to post). I probably should describe myslef  but I don't feel like it right now  so that'll wait until tomorrow. ,0
  Well  sorry for not posting. Instead of telling about myself  I'll just update my profile. Learn about me there. --- Pretty uneventful week  except for yesterday. I got a haircut and saw Spider-Man 2. THAT MOVIE IS FREAKING AWESOME!!! If I had the time  I would have seen it again. But I am moving in about 2 weeks and I have tons of stuff to pack still. That and I am broke. I am owed $140 and have not gotten it yet. I thought I would have gotten it sooner so I spent all my money and now I have about $2 on me. Oh well  I might get the money this weekend. We shall see.   That's pretty much it for now. I will post again when it is convenient. ,0
  Well  I still didn't get paid today. Now my boss at the card shop I work at owes me $220. Hopefully I'll be getting it tommorrow (plus some extra). I had to sit in the shop ALONE for about 6 hours with only one break. Only ONE person came in. Oh well  everyone comes on Sunday anyway. ---------------------------------- I also took an IQ test about 10 minutes ago  and it said my IQ is 133. I think that's pretty good  I'm not sure exactly. I took different tests before though and they all gave me different results. So I'm not sure what my IQ REALLY is. Oh well  I really could care less.   That's all for today  see ya tommorrow! ,0
  Pretty uneventful week  but I am starting my own RPG  using RPG maker 2003. The title is Seal of the  Ancients: A Hero is Born. I am currently working on  the plot and characters and I have a good bit of  graphics for it. I will post news on it as I get more  done on it. I will also include screenshots and parts  of the story. Thats all that really happened. I also  have a lot of energy all of a sudden. I feel like  getting outside and doing all kinds of things. But  it's getting late so I'll do stuff tommorrow. I write  whenever I can/feel like it/have the time. ,0
  Today is shaping up to be an extremely frustrating day.  For some reason  whenever B has Guard Duty  the kids think that it is a good time to be their most obnoxious.  And to top it all off  my period is due tomorrow which cuts my tolerance in half.  I have been so exhausted the last couple of days  I'm not sure if there is something going around or if it just the 10 years of interupted sleep that is finally catching up with me.  I have no energy and all I want to do is eat.  I need to get out and do something.  Still mulling over the idea of a move to AL.  Sometimes the thought of starting over in a new place is very refreshing and at other times  terrifying.  Truth is though  I probably don't have the drive to move this whole family.  And I know that B is pretty happy right where we are  if he got a little better job we would probably be very comfortable  and wouldn't even be considering a move.  I've done so much work with tweaking his resume and getting it out there that every time he has an interview and it doesn't work out  it almost feels like a rejection of me.  Stupid I know  and he totally takes it in stride  but I am starting to get frustrated that people don't see his potential and qualifications.  Well  I should really get busy and get something done today  there is a ton of laundry to put away and maybe I'll bake something.  It is a gorgeous day out and not too hot yet  so it is great weather for baking. ,0
  For half the day I practiced a song that my sisters and I are singing at my Dad's 4th wedding Friday night.  The song is a bit ironic considering his track record  but what are you going to do?  I was pleasantly surprised with how well it went.  Now we just have to try it at the church with amplification.  Scary!!  It is mildy terrifying as I haven't sung in public for approx. 11 years.  I figure if I just close my eyes I'll be okay.  I am really dreading the whole weekend.  We have the rehearsal on Thursday night  rehearsal for a wedding my son is in at 3pm on Friday  Dad's wedding at 6:30pm Friday night  than the other wedding at 1pm on Saturday.  I won't have a minutes breathing space until Sunday  on which we are invited to my nephews birthday party.  Bleah!!!!  And sometime in there  B has to fix his bosses car that is apart in our garage.  I really do hate weekends like this almost as bad as Guard weekend. ,0
  I ache for freedom yet I refuse to do it  I am not brave. I have the means to do it  but do I have the guts? No  I don't. That may be a good thing  it may not  but what can I do? mc  I blame you. ,0
  I got stung by a hornet today. I cried. If I can't handle that kind of pain  how on Earth would I be able to do it? ,0
  It was a cold kind of day. The kind of cold kind of day that makes you chilly if you happen to be out side without warm clothes on. That is how cold it was. And  it just so happens that a character in this story happened to be out side on this cold day without any warm clothes on. In fact  he was not wearing any clothes at all. For that reason  and other reasons too  it was imperative that he find shelter immediately. Or soon there after. He had never experienced a day like this before. Ever before. Never in his lifetime before. He hopes to never experience anything like this again. but is what he hopes for really what is best for him? Only time will tell. This is the story of a man. Of a boy. Of a legend that no has heard of. Of a hero that no one knows. It will make you laugh. It will make you cry. You will read it from start to finish. You will not be able to put it down. You just wait. You will think you are just reading a book. You should know better. You will soon realize  the book is reading you.  He was running through the snow like a blind man. All he could see was white. Endless white. Everywhere he turned. Everywhere he fell. No matter where he looked. All there was  was white. The poor boy. He went flying as he tripped over a particularly bumpy patch of white. Over the cliff he went. Into the void. He fell for what seemed like only seconds  but really days passed as he fell. What could he do though  besides fall? Well really quite a lot  but how was he to know? If he had read the instructional manual before he took the plunge he would have known that in order to stop falling  all he had to do was simply to stop. ,0
"  I saw Leif yesterday.  For those of you who don't know he used to be my old roommate and a good friend of mine until he tried to rip me off anyway he could with rent and bills.  He also lied to me every opportunity he got  and then he had the audacity to tell Ryan that I lie all the time about everything.  I really could care less if I ever see him again.        Anyway  I was walking through the mall with Ryan and her mom yesterday and he and his daughter were looking at purses.  I saw him and I tried to get away from him without him noticing me.  It didn't work.  ""Yeah  that's right  Adam.  You just keep on walking "" he said.  ""Okay "" I responded and I kept on walking.  He responded with  ""Shmuck!""  And then he saw Ryan and said  ""Hey  baby.  How are you?""  I guess he still likes her.  I have no idea.  I really hope that's the last time I see him but I doubt it is.  A few weeks ago Ryan and I were driving back to her house and when we got to her street he was driving past us.  We turned around to see if that was him  and he turned around and drove past us again.  We turned down another street to get back to her house.  He passed us again.  Each time he covered his face  and Jennifer (another former roommate of ours who is now dating Leif) covered her face so I guess we wouldn't recognize her.  We never saw him again that day  but is he stalking me now?  Was he just bored so he got his two kids and girlfriend in the car and set out to find me?  Will I ever be rid of this guy?    Last night  I got home and Belinda (my roommate for another month) was in the kitchen.  She was leaving to go stay at a friend's house for the night  but before she left she told me that my room smelled bad.  She blamed it on my shoes or trash in my trash can.  She told me I needed to get some candles or an air freshener.  This caused a fight.  It was our first fight since moving into the place last August.  The only thing that I smell in my room is the air freshener that she put into my room a month ago that smells horrible.  My shoes are brand new and therefore do not stink.  The only trash I have in my room is paper.  My room is the only room in the house that actually smells good.  The rest of the house smells like her sausage and Slim Jims.  Anyway  I cleaned my room last night and hopefully she'll be happy now.  I only have three more weeks left in this place and after that I won't have to deal with this anymore. ",0
"  Well  welcome to my blog  we'll see if this lasts long or not. I've just been sitting in my house in the dark all by myself today and thought if I did this maybe someone would care what I thought. If you recognize the title congratulations to you  you've probably got alot better idea of who I am then most. I've done things like this before and have been told I'm ""fucking hillarious"" so we'll see. Today I'm not feeling very comical just feeling alone and bored. Anyway that's about it for now if you want to know more  just ask. ",0
  Ok  so it's like 4 in the morning and I've laid in bed for 2 hours trying to go to sleep and it's just not working.  I decided to cruise some blogs and then thought oh yeah  I have that one I should work on. I've been thinking way too much tonight  probably why I can't sleep. Anyway to the point  reading blogs I began to think man there are some really damaged people out there. I wonder am I one of them..........do you ever realize  come to an ephipany  hey I'm a really screwed up person........or do you just think everyone else is and you're normal? ,0
  Through time all the conflict in society essentially boils down to either greed  power   or a difference in opinions otherwise unresolvable. From the biggest wars to a fight on the playground it's always one of those 3 things. So you might be wondering what the hell that has to do with anything. My point out of that is that conflict is inevitable and necessary. I can't stand people who think everyone should just tolerate everything even if it conflicts with their own personal views. That's like telling me I should hold out my hands and let someone take a shit on them and like it. Do you have to agree with me  Hell No! Do I have to agree with you  Hell No! What if we just can't come to an agreement............then it's time for a fight! I do have to tell you something.........while you were picking daisys and doing drugs and watching TV.........I was working out  eating right and learning how to fight. So when the shit hits the fan and conflict is inevitable who's side would you rather be on? ,0
  Hello friends  foes  and faggamuffins! Welcome to El Blog. I bet you're wondering how this blog came to be. What is its innate purpose? Is the world ready for it? Where can I get a good ham sandwhich at 2am?   The truth is this. Last night  I was walking my scottydog  Monty  with x-large inside-out baggie ready in hand and a mountain of frustration building. It always takes Monty at least 20 mintues to find the perfect patch of grass to excrete his waste matter upon. This is because he knows the very second that last tappering chunk hits the ground he will be whiplashed across the lawn back up into the apartment (well  ok  a slight pause as my bagged hand scoops up his hot  steaming pile). Anyway  last night  he was really taking his time. It had been 35 minutes and we had yet to find the night's sanctuary of defecation. Just as I was about to give up all hope and line the livingroom with newspaper and Bush campaign posters  he popped a squat. It was  THEN!  when I bent over to collect the night's batch that it  hit me . Yes  that one delayed missle-launched chunk    but also   an idea!  Create my very own Blog!  And so here it is. As for the other questions  folks  I have no answers. I just ask them. ,0
  Oh yeah. I forgot that I'm supposed to write in this thing every week. Thanks  Beth for reminding me. Really  I'm just waiting to upgrade it with ghetto bootilicious FX before I unveil it. Beth is supposed to help me with that since she's the blogmaster.  I saw the Bourne Supremecy last night. Ehh. The first one was more dimentional. This one was just pure action  jackson.  And what's up with Michael Jackson having quads? ,0

And by ""figure out"" I mean ask Beth. Frick! It's 2am and it's a work nite. I guess I'll hurl myself down the stairs so I don't have to go in tomorrow. Yea!!! No work!!! ",0
  It has been crazy getting here  as I started this journey on 24th April. I have just started working again last week. I set off late on Saturday with my pick-up truck and a U-Haul trailer full of all my stuff and made it to Arizona (2415 miles) in 3 days. The truck then promptly broke down 70 miles away from my cousins house! What are the chances of driving that far and then it packing up on her doorstep?   After 2 weeks the mechanics at the garage managed to figure out the computer had gone on the truck and that is why it had stopped which would have been great if it had not been the air sensor that was the problem. Although I did get to do some of the best mountain biking of my life in a place call Sedona  AZ so who cares?!   With the truck still out of action  I was forced to ride to California on my Triumph 955i motorcycle  through some of the best desert roads on the planet - life is hard sometimes! When I got to California  Scott a friend of mine put me up in his house in Orange County  which was very cool of him as I stayed there for 3 weeks and he never once complained about the smell. I had a copious amount of job interviews during this time and was offered a number of them  but in the end I have gone back to working for Rentokil-Initial for the third time!   Therefore  with a few weeks to kill before I was due to start working again  I went off for a ride on the Triumph up through the mountains of California to Lake Tahoe. Tahoe is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen and well worth a visit if you are ever out this way. I then rode back down through the deserts of Nevada past Area 51 and Death Valley to Las Vegas and back to my cousins house in Arizona. It was good to relax  do some camping  laugh and point at fat Americans and take some time out.    So I am now back to working in the Tropical Plants Division  selling plant services (selling flowers in San Francisco may sound a little gay to you and to be far it is!!).   I am happy out here in San Jose  it is incredible. It has a wonderful climate  is close to the sea and mountains  San Francisco is also really close and Lake Tahoe is only 3 hours away for some great snowboarding!! I am so happy to be out of New York!  Thanks for visiting my blogger!  Ian ,0

  I'm not complete idiot. I'm not the person you think I am. I'm not putting my name for my saftey  for the fear of being ridiculed by my peers. This is a record of my life and this is how I intend to keep it.  I was never the most popular boy in school. I couldn't do magic nor could I hold a wand right. Brooms I could never control  and potions I never could suceed. I was not very smart  until I had a inspiration. Ronald Weasley  thats who. He was nothing then  but I knew that he was to be the future Samurai. I studied harder than ever  and was ridiculed by my brothers more than ever before  and I dared not to tell them my plans. My brothers spited me  or should I say my half brothers. I had in all  2 brothers  all older. Kenji and Kenshin were at large  and the two Samurais  not to mention. I am just a mage  a fire mage. Fire mages were not fun to be because they have bright firey colored hair. This  I have  But the hot temper I do not have. Project 1242 (AKA The Weasley Project) would raise my success rate more than ever.  I soon studied very hard  but the years passed and soon it was too late to pull my plan off. So  I spent days of thinking and finally figured out what to do. I would aim my sights at the next decendant. His name was Riley Cook  and he was not born yet  so I had more time than ever. I studied hard and got stronger. You may not yet know my plans but here they are: I will become Riley's master so he will gain respect for the lost brother of the Samurais. This was my plan  well  the base of it. In my mind (and in millions of folders and disks) I went through the plan over and over again. It was completely full proof by the time Riley was born  but yet I kept gaining more and more knowledge of things around me and got stronger and stronger  but I did not change the way I looked  I did not want to scare the kid like I know Kenshin and Kenji would do.  I must stop writing now because my Ri is waking from a nightmare and I feel the need to comfort him. ,0
  Well  this looks to be my first post on a blog ever...yes...er...have to try this again soon  bye bye. ,0
  Should Social Security be run by the government? Is government good at doing that sort of thing? When I attended a student meeting with one of the chair's of the Fed (in NYC) he said that there are two things that the US has to worry about economically in the future. The first is the trade deficit turning over and the second is the retirement of the baby boomers. Now I read your (MWS) post to Joe Crow about SS' funding till 2040 but the best estimates I can find (the only economist I can find who says otherwise is Paul Krugman from the NYTimes  so maybe I'm off base since he's a superb economist) state that under the pay-as-you-go system within a dozen years the retirement benefits mandated by current law will exceed SS payroll taxes. So we're talking about tax increases within our (or at least my) lifetime (Fortune article called it The $44 Trillion Abyss).  Now  as you mentioned earlier  any serious student of human nature has to look at the world realistically. When you put a social safety net (just like free health care) in place  what's gonna happen? It will be overused...that is human nature unless people are given a clever incentive to do otherwise (I leave wiggle room here in case Im forced to recant later). People are going to plan on using it  not everybody  not all the time  but those guys on the margin of making a decision on savings will tend to take this retirement benefit into account and  god forbid  plan on it. The system is going to HAVE TO handle the stress from the poor and disabled AS WELL AS the free riders. Now  that's not say that SS is altogether bad  socializing some costs is important  but the pay-as-you-go system is totally ridiculous! You get one guy who knows about accounting and one guy who knows about demographics in a room together and they'll tell you something's got to give: either taxes go up or benefits go down or a little of both. Maybe another variant would work better  but the most libertarians I meet get annoyed when their childrens futures are being taxed away before their eyes.  Sorry about the lengthIm getting my own thoughts in order and Im not as concise as Id like. ,0
"  First off  let me say that English is not my native tongue but I want this to be understood for as much people as possible. So  why ""Old words for a new blog""? Well  the ""new blog"" part is easy: this is the first time that I do something like this. And the ""old words""? That's the reason I'm putting these words here.  Right now I'm in the office. My hands  my fingers  my knees are shaking; I'm lucky of being sit down. I also have a little headache and my stomach hurts bad. Do I have the flu? Nope  but it's because of something as old as the flu: I'm in love.   I admit it  I'm in love with one of my office mates; in fact  shes my only mate because there's only the two of us here at the offcice. We're completly alone.   I don't wanna tell all the story now from the beginning  I'll do it on another time. Today  I just need to say that she's not in love with me. She hasn't told it that way  but I know it and the knowing of it it's what's killing me deep inside  making me feel really really bad. I don't know words in English to express the pain I'm going thru but I'm sure many of you know what I'm talking about. So you can imagine my situation. She's only a few steps away from me but that distance is an abyss I cannot jump. So close and so far. I wanna reach out and touch her  feel her skin (the smoothest skin ever) but I can't. And I'm dying. That's pretty close to what I'm feeling now; I feel like I'm dying.   Why she didn't tell me that she didnt feel anything about me?  Why did she let me believe that I had any opportunity with her? ",0
  Yea  silence is the key. I try only to speak about job stuff. The rest of the time  may the silence rule the place. Why? Because I'm trying to forget her and the first step to forget a girl u have to see everyday is ignoring her. So I hardly say a word. ,0
"  I'm trying to understand a couple of things of wildly different importance.  First post is baseball.  Major League Baseball's insistence that their All-Star game decide which league receives the privelege of home field advantage in the World Series is ridiculous.  This policy blows my mind.  There are so many inequities in allowing a collection of individuals from different teams to come together and decide an important post-season rule such as home field advantage.  First of all  as evidenced by last night's debacle  one person's failure can crush an entire league's hopes.  Roger Clemens comes in and lays an egg and the next thing you know the National League doesn't have a chance.  This year's example is particularly strange  since A.L. batters came into the game with the luxury of having faced Clemens multiple timessomething most N.L. hitters could not say about their encounter with Mark Mulder to start the game.  Also  because of MLB's insistence that at least one player from each team be represented  players with no real vested interest in which league gets home field advantage are deciding the outcome.  I doubt Livan Hernandez is particularly concerned with the post-season this year.  So if he faces someone like Derek Jeter  the stakes are unequal to the point of unfairness.  Another thing about all of the ""This Time it Counts"" garbage is the fact that the game is still played like an exhibition.  If the game is really supposed to count  then I want Barry Bonds in for the whole game.  I don't want Roger Clemens pitching on a couple hours of sleep because of all of his All-Star festivity obligations.  I want Mike Piazza  not Johnny Estrada (no offense to the promising young catcher)  trying to make up a 5-run deficit.  I mean  I'm a Cubs fan.  They have a chance to play in the World Series and it makes a huge difference to the club and fans alike whether more games are played at Wrigley Field.  But that point is moot because the All-Star game is supposed to be an exhibition.  What would be the point of naming Estrada as an All-Star if he didn't get a chance to play.  It's all just stupid.  It's an idea that never should have been let out of the think tank.  Baseball should take a page from the NBA and NFL.  The team with the best regular season record gets home field advantage...it's pretty simple  really. ",0

  Kevin got an email from the sportswear place asking his salary range.  Although unscrupulous  I intercepted this email via webmail and replied with a 25k-30k requirement  citing that the last job held paid 28k with benefits.  After sending this email  I let it remain in the inbox to be downloaded to his outlook.  As predicted  he saw the email and wanted to respond to it with a 25-30k requirement.  I am good.  So while he was indisposed in the shitter  I made a dummy email that said the same thing and sent it to a dummy email addy.  It was bounced back undeliverable  but I deleted it from the inbox and deleted mail box so he'll never know the difference.  When he came back in from the bathroom  he read the sent copy and was satisfied with the reply.  Not that he should actually send his own stuff.  I made the resume.  I wrote the cover letter.  I found the job.  I applied him for it.  Then he has the audacity to tell me he has to do everything because I ask him to bring me something from the kitchen while he is up and already in the kitchen.  Hmmmm.  He better get this friggin job because I'll be god damned if I have to sell my car so we can get by and I have to drive a junk piece of shit even though I make a ton of money.  Sad  but true  I have to pay for every bill  plus my debt  rent  car payment  vacation fund (which I made a separate one for me) pet costs  food  EVERYTHING.  He even asked if I could use my credit card to buy him toys.  What?  I don't think so asshole.  If I have to do without some things I like  so do you.  I'm contemplating giving up my car  that I worked hard for  but you want to go on buying fucking toys?!  Not going to happen! ,0

  Okay i admit it  i didnt find out about this place all by myself  it took some networking  and finally ive found a place where i can write everything that comes to mind  bullshit and non!  I owe my new blogspot to a internet pal  MizzDanya  i believe her blog is called DanyaDamnit  so ya'll check it out...damnit!Anyway she's only 19 and so strangely intelligent  fo real ya'll her mindset got me thinking about some things  even had me considering firing my current friends and trying to make some new ones..will provide ya'll with aplications further down  or just email me and request one!Anyway got some friends down here who i told to check out her page and girlfriend is surrrrious..lol she had us all rrrolling with her experiences worldwide  from South Africa to Heathrow  so make sure when ya'll have time..(you betta make time) check out ma homegirl Danya  and be in for a rude awakening.. Now about moi  im a Zimbabwean who has been lost in Toronto for about 6 years now.Seriously im lost  im guessing that i will need about 3 million dollars to tavel the world and find a place where i can get in where i fit in  it just doesnt seem right.Life of monotony  bills and same ol bullshit different day  why do they make it seem so easy on all those travelling shows  especially with that Brit guy   Ian who has a hella good time wherever he Globe trots???  I need me a damn job like that  pssshhttt half of those jack asses cant even pronounce the places they visit..so ive set out to do a 360 on my life firing friends i should have got rid of a long time ago  re-establishing contact with those i should have kept in contact with  doing some physical changes here and there  damn i cant dump my boyfrend?? I guess he can stay  but i will be keeping an eye out on his ass... hopefully ya'll will follow my blog and see how things turn out  till than my question still remains  can i borrow a dollar or maybe 3 million?? ,0
  Okay... so maybe this thing is the new livejournal bandwagon. Who knows. Don't really care at this point. I'm far too lazy to maintain my own blog atm  so this is going to work just fine for me.   I find myself wondering why I persist in this constant struggle with my shape. It seems like no matter how much I cut back or how much I exercise  I don't change all that much. I'm supposed to hit the Dr in 2 weeks to have her tell me I'm too fat. Thrilling  eh?   Also we have shifting managerial garbage over at work  and that has me stressed out. I  want  assistant manager really badly. I don't know if it'll ever happen. At this point  I'm afraid to transfer over to the other store I'm offered right now because of a few things.  One  the store itself is a nightmare. Everyone steals. Employees  customers  you name it.  Two  It's huge. More work. I feel like I bust my ass as it is. The story I hear about the new place is that no matter what happens  no matter what you do  it always gets undone. No matter how fast. You come in next shift and it's a warzone.  Three  The drive time. I don't want to commute again. I like having my 5 minutes to and from.  Now.. it's a good thing to transfer. Bigger store = more money and more hours. But that doesn't mean that it'll compensate for the amount of time taken from my day or the cash guzzling car's gas tank I'll be paying out the nose for.  The largest deterrant  however  is the fact that I'll have to close during the week. I don't want to. Closing's a pain in the ass. Sure  it's the easier of the two shifts  but hey  I don't like being up that late and not having anything to do when you get home because it's too late to watch a movie and you're too wound up to sleep. The only plus to that is that most likely  I'd no longer have to do inventory shifts.   At any rate  I decided not to take it. I just have to call the boss and tell her tomorrow. I want it  but they'd have to at least give me a 1.15 raise just to have me do it. That's what my time's going to cost them if they want me down there that badly. Which they won't. Heh. ,0
  This is dedicated to my uncle  who died on duty at the age of 29  doing police work...       The Day I Cried   ------------------------------------            Those that I fight I do not hate         Those that I guard I do not love;  - (An Irish Airman Foresees His Death  W.B. Yeats)      It was all white in the room     The corpse in his winding sheet     My aunt in a new white sari     Staring into the silence where he had gone.    I could hear the leaves rustle outside the window  But I didnt cry.      She had gone crazy  my mom whispered     Between her sobs  She is just 25  the poor girl    I just continued to look down     At the mosaic floor  not registering a word.    I could hear the white saris softly flapping  But I couldnt cry.      My cousin sister came to me     Dressed in her prettiest frock for the occasion.    She was five  did she understand?    I took her out to buy her chocolate.    I could hear the neighbors shushing as we went by  But I still didnt cry.      On my way back in the train     Three passengers were discussing the police     All corrupt sons of bitches  they deserve to die    I remembered you  uncle  so proud of your uniform.    I could still hear my aunt screaming as nani lit your pyre  Thats when I cried.    --V. ,0

"  Awoke this morning to a text message from Rob  obviously sent before he went on his way to Alton Towers.  Decided not to get up straightaway though  a mistake in itself as when I did get up I'd got a raging headache!  Managed to get my car cleaned and dried just as it started to rain  ah well...at least it's looking better than it was.  Btw  the text is a little bit too risque to publish on here  but it referred to the frolics of yesterday afternoon. *blushes*     Got someone else coming to see the house later this afternoon...a first-time lady buyer apparently.  Seems like the influx of Londoners coming into the sticks hasn't ceased as this is the fourth so far.  I just find it weird really that there have been ""so many"" of them...mustn't complain though if they're interested in buying the place.     Found out today that Helen is changing her car next week from the Corsa to a People Carrier type vehicle.  Not sure what it is as yet  but I'll get to see it sooner or later!

  It's strange how one can wake up in a morning feeling that the day is going to be great  only to find that as each minute ticks  things slowly seem to get worse.  Today is one of those days.  Worse than just the average Monday feeling  I haven't felt any good until just now when I started to think about the days events.  I guess when you reach a rock bottom  the only way is up  so I'm trying to think positive that come tomorrow things will all fit into perspective.   Still not heard anything from Morrisons  although they should have received my letter last Friday.  Not really sure what sort of response I'll get but it has to be better than the response I got from Customer Services last week.  We'll see how it goes.   Spoke to Rob  but felt too miserable to say much.  Looks like an early night for me. ,0
"  So here I sit at work. Only three more hours left  I guess that's not so bad. It's over time so that makes it even better.    This online Blog idea was very clever. The user interface is very easy to use. I like it.    So when is it too soon to say I love you to someone? Or is there even a time limit on feelings and emotions. I don't think there is. I use to. I use to never believe in love at first sight. But just because you don't believe in something  doesn't mean it's not there. It's amazing how I use to think when someone would say  ""Oh you'll know when you've found the person you want to spend the rest of your life with."" I'd think to myself  how can that possibly be? How can you possibly know that just after meeting someone. Use to think it was all just movie talk  hollywood glamour to sell movies and merchandise. But I believe it now. I think deep down in my heart I had always wanted to believe it  but never wanted to get my hopes up for fear of being let down.    An Ex of mine use to get so aggrivated with me during our break up  cause he kept asking me if I see him in my future. I kept telling him I don't know. Because well  I don't. He kept asking if I had hopes for us to be together again  and I said  No. I don't have hopes for anything. Never have. It's better to have never hoped for anything  then to have been let down by those false hopes. But is it better to have loved and lost  then to have never loved? Going through the break up  I began thinking it's better to have never loved. But in recent events  I couldn't change my mind quick enough. I would rather have loved  and lost. The joy of being with that one person  and sharing moments and experiences that would never be the same  is priceless.    Well there is quite alot there to read. hehe I guess I should probably get some work done. ",0
  Thought I'd start off with a couple favorite poems of mine.   In This World - Love has no color - yet how deeply my body is stained by  yours.

The mind has a thousand eyes  and the heart but one; yet the light of a whole life dies when it's love is done. ,0

So not really a day at all! Yay!       Intresting incident walking to the stop de bus avec le Sharon - I swung my PE kit at her head. Now if she was normal  it would've flown over her head  and she would've just been scared of being hit in the head. Whereas Sharon  not being normal  held her phone in the way. So it pinged into the road! Ah-hah. Well  it was really funny at the time. Then I bought a lighter  and I made the flame big(ish)  only it wouldn't go out  and scared my thumb.       Then saw Will.

"  I am addicted to blogs!  After reading my friend Beth and Cs's blog  I was intrigued...I had a site on diaryland  but after so much time of not logging in  it was dismanteled  so to say.  Anyway  on Cs's page she has blogs that she reads  and lists as favorites or something like that  so I clicked on a few  and became addicted.

  Being really bored again... I shall post.    Yesterday I went on a date with Elise. We went to see King Arthur. The theatre was nearly empty because it was 4pm on a Tuesday  but these two fat men sat a seat away from us. I think I counted 7 other people in the whole theatre. Not to mention one of these guys got on his cell phone for about 30 minutes. HOLY SHIT!!! I swear  some people need to be shot. Anyways  after the movie we sat in the parking lot debating about where to eat. Of course Elise refused to contribute  except for places within eyesight  so I had to choose. We finally went to Orlando's  where we proceded to eat overpriced (but very very good)  food. Afterwards we went to Elise's mom's house cuz her mom had made a chocalate cake. I stayed for about an hour then went home. I would have stayed longer  but I didnt want to overstay my welcome (especially since I havent been there in quite some time). All in all  I think the whole thing went pretty good.   Today I woke up at noon  which I HATE doing  but I was so tired. Yesterday I had to wake up really early to take Olivia to someone's house cuz my dad was going out of town. He goes out of town almost every week for his job. Olivia goes over to one of my dad's friend's house so I dont have to be chained down watching her.

"  Hmm. I'm Really Not Sure If I'm Ready For Highschool. Not That I Have A Choice. I'm Sort Of Forced Into It. I'm Actually More Afraid Of My Grades Than Anything Else. I Mean  They're Not That Important  Right? They Just Control The Rest Of Your Life  Like Wether You Become A Scientist  A Doctor  A Drug Dealer  A Bum  Or Even Worse  Someone Who Works At Mc. Donalds. I Think The Only Way I'm Going To Last All Four Years Is Not Taking Crap From Teachers  Not Getting Beat Up  Taking EVERY Non-Athletic Extra-Curricular Activity They Offer  Bury Myself In Schoolwork And My Wiccan Duties  And Not Leave Myself Any Time To Get Upset About How Screwed Up My Life Is. I Hope My Friends Will Be Reliable Through My Highschool Years  Unlike Current Times  And Help Me Say  ""HEY LIFE  YEAH  I'M TALKING TO YOU! FUCK YOU! YOU HEAR ME? FUCK YOU!Recently It Just Seems Like Everyone And Everything Is Out To Piss Me Off. The People Who I Like Are Impossible To Get A Hold Of  As I Have No Means Of Contact  And I'm Getting Scared About Everyone Around Me Doing Drugs And Drinking  And Talking About Nothing More Than Sex  And If Not Sex  Than Suicide. Talk About A Trade-Up. Oh Yeah  Something Good Happened Yesterday. I Won 3 Fish At The Fouth Of July Carnival (on the 2 of july) ",0
"  Have You Ever Noticed That Every Couple Of Years Of So  You Notice You Really Never Cared About Something. For Me  The First Thing Was The Friends Televisoin Show On The WB.  I Know It Sounds Funny  But I Almost Felt As Though I Was Growing Too Old Too Quickly. I Still Feel The Same Way. When I Was Younger  It Was Completly Different.  I Wished I Could Gett Magically Older  Or Taller So I Could Do The Things That The Older Kids Got To Do.  Now I Think About It  It Was Never Really That big Of A Deal Like I Made It Out To Be.     I'm Soo Not Ready For Highschool.  Everyone Else  It Seems  Are All Excitd  But I'm Scared. I Don't Even Know Why  Really  It's Not That I'm Afraid I'll ""Get My Ass Kicked "" As My Sister Says  I Think It's More About After Highschool.  I'm Afraid My Friends And I Will Sort Of Go Our Seperate Ways After Highschool.  I Mean  Shit  I Have More Trouble Just Trying To Get A Hold Of Some Of My Friends Now...... ",0
"  I am quite new to this kind of ""expressing yourself in writing"" stuff. I don't know why many of my friends got addicted to blogger. I said to myself ... ""Hmm .. why not give it a try.  Perhaps the major obstacle that always keeps me from writing in web is being afraid of what other people are gonna say about my writing. But I realize that this is not about showing off how many vocabularies you've had so far  it's about ""expressing yourself"" dude.. well I hope .. and i really hope it could be a continous habit for me besides studying for my master degree and guitaring ... coz i know this is a really good habit !

"  Arghh .. I barely could move single part of my bodies  I was really burned out from yesterday's workout.  Adit asked me to join him to gym and I said  ""Hell Yeah ! Bring it On .."" but a little voice from my heart said ""are u serious about this?"" Well .. I dragged myself to Gym because I need to.  Thanks to my supportive girlfriend that said I could be able to do my all kinds of activities much faster from working out since it would stimulate both of your mind and body.  Well i think it's time for me to do my routinity  back to school in an hour and thanks God the Prof is not that boring.  O yeah .. forgot to mention about yesterday's activities .... it was a combo-day ! I did a lot of stuffs in only a single day ... i did practice of trying to imitate the solo of Dewa and Joe Satriani with my Fender Strato  I studied and worked on my homework (Finally! this is a rare thing to do)  going to Gym (ran about almost 1 mile  lifted up some of machines  basketball and soccer)  and called my GF =). At nite  my girlfriend threw out some matters that almost startled me ... I was surprised but on the other hand I said to myself  it;s really common to have those.   I tried to lessen her burdens  sometimes I do really want to remove all the burdens what she's got but I couldn't ... maybe I am also struggling with the same problem ...  Hopefully someday  the day when we 've matured enough would retrieve the solution. We often discussed many things and if we somewhat hurt one another's feeling  one of us standed up and said sorry. So the problem ended on that day.  Oh ... I need to prepare myself going to shcool  haven't taken a shower and breakfast ...  signed off ",0
"  Alright... I just browsed through a ton of blogs. I'm procrastinating working on my thesis... but it's so damn boring! Anyway  people put the stupidest stuff on their blogs! If you want random people to read about your life  don't post 2-word inside jokes... Blogs should be about your life... Or at least something worthwhile. Saying a bunch of random quick words that only your friends understand should be saved for your damn IM away messages. Your mindless blogs are getting in the way of people seeing mine! And mine aren't worthless. Mine are cool. They're not about ""I went to the store and bought some flip-flops"" but about crazy weird stories that happen to me at the mental hospital or about how I visited Bob Jones University 6 times in high school or about how I had to wear skirts below the middle of my knees to school before they came into style or about how I got kicked out of my Christian high school for having cigarettes in my car (I wasn't even smoking them!) or about how after this happened  I tried to commit suicide (that was long ago  I'm doing fine now  but thanks for asking) and while I was in the hospital being injected with crazy stuff that would make me crap and vomit until I could hardly breathe or swallow my God-fearing  compassionate high school principal was telling my parents how I was expelled. Well  at any rate... I won't bore you with worthless inside jokes. Hell  if you bother to read my blog  you'll be the better for it... you know why? Cuz I've got alot of really weird stories. ",0
  Well  I have so much to say and so little time in which to say it. I'm going to have lots of cool stuff on here  just you wait. All my opinions on stuff and my innovative fashion ideas and my rants and reviews of current fashions... then I'll tell you a thing or two about what it's like to live in Indiana... the most conservative place on earth I fear... and all my fears and opinions about politics.  Then somewhere in the middle of it all... I'll tell you about my life.  Maybe it will come out as part of the other two subjects  or maybe I'll just feel like ranting. But check back now and again and stay posted to my crazy world and all my opinions thereof. By the way  I work in a mental hospital and I have fascinating stories about my early Christian school experiences...  stay tuned! ;-)   Lily ,0
"  This is kind of a wierd thing  having the opportunity to write about nothing in particular with no intended audience.  I'm not really sure if this is something I will do or not  but maybe I'll give it a whirl and see how it goes.  Basically  here's my story: I'm from a small town in southwestern Minnesota.  I grew up raising cattle and growing corn  wheat  and soybeans.  I had and still have both my parents as well as a brother and two sisters.  I was a smart kid in my high school and was always in the top of my class.  I never partied or got in trouble and was generally a good kid.     Then I went to college.   I went to NDSU in Fargo  ND in the fall of 1997.  There I learned to appreciate the sweet necture of life that was and is beer.  There I met some of my best friends and learned of the best mixes of all manners of alcohol.  We partied hard for 2 wonderful years.  Then  I got a letter from the dean.  I was asked not to come back to NDSU in the fall.  They figured that having 2 years to think about things  I'd be better off.     Well  what's a guy to do?     This guy decided he needed to get his head on straight.  I went out to work as a camp cook at a bible camp I had went to as a kid.  It was a rustic fort in the Black Hills of South Dakota with no electricity or running water.  All I had to cook with was a fire and a hand pump.  It was wonderful.  We'd shower only once a week  hike miles a day  and have lots of time just to commune with nature.     While I was out at the camp I talked with a friend who was changing schools.  The four-year schooling at a ""typical"" college was wearing on him and he needed something different.  He was joining up with a buddy that went to a Tech School for Fluid Power Technology (hydraulics and pneumatics primarily).  Well  I thought that sounded as good as any options I had so I signed up over the phone.  Never set foot in the building til the first day of class.  Turned out  that was one of the best decisions I ever made.   But  that's probably enough for now.  If anybody's even reading this  I'll fill some more in later.   Cheers  Drewbie ",0
  I've got to go watch my favorite television shows  so I'll be brief.    As a conservative  I'm more than a little fed up with the liberal bias in the media. Disgusted isn't really the right word-I'm disgusted with the blatant anti-Americanism of the flag-burning war protestors  I'm disgusted with the self-absorbed corruption at the UN-but the media bias...it can best be compared to a child singing an annoying song  incessantly  over and over again. They're AWARE that they're injecting bias into their news. They're AWARE that it's wrong. However  they're not going to stop doing it...because on one level  the annoying song-singing child enjoys singing the song  on another  it enjoys annoying the people around it. Eh  that's the best comparison I can come up with on such short notice.   Perusing the internet a couple of years back  I came across this wonder of wonders: THE BLOG. Conservatives around the nation had taken opportunity of this new miracle of technology to protest the liberal media. Good for them.   Since then  both the media and the celebrities around the nation have turned up the heat on their criticism of Bush  all the while proclaiming that there was a 'chill wind' of repression silencing them. Such sheer pretentiousness on their part served to give me a headache for a few hours  but nothing more.   However  they've begun to go to far. They've gone beyond the realm of 'bias' into the realm of 'propaganda.' I realized this after I was able to deconstruct the basis of a Time magazine article ('How we got Homeland Security wrong) with a calculator  access to google  and no more than five minutes of my own time. When something like this happens-when a trusted and widely read magazine starts putting out bullshit that can be disproved with eighth-grade research and math skills...well  things have gotten pretty bad.   Instead of sitting around and bitching about it  I've decided to throw my weight into the fight  by starting this blog. Whenever I can  I'll point out liberal media innaccuracies. Whenever I want to  I'll write opinion pieces.   However  unlike the mainstream media  I'll be honest with you. This Blog will be replete with right-wing bias  ranging from moderate to  as the media would put it  'extreme.'   Thank you. ,0
  ANGEL        I dont think much about it anymore  but there was a time I couldnt get it out of my head.     It was a day I didnt think I would survive  the metropolis of intuition that was vacuumed in my mind was endless.  I wanted to get it out and fast.  I hate myself when I am so inconsistent and incoherent.  I am in a state that cannot be reversed or understood.  I cant remedy it.     Sex was never as good with her as it was in my mind.     There is nothing like cotton t-shirt sheets.     I feel creative but cant understand why.  Its been months since I have written.     The sunlight wakes me again  and I want to die.     I hear Massive Attack in my head..the soft ambient noise in my mind that seems to always be there.  Angel  Angel  Angel.  I love that girls voice. ,0
  I understand     It is defined by truth and reality  it is not the love I feel for you that is truest  and it is my action in response to that love.  I love you because in china a butterfly flapped its wings.  I love you because the centrifugal force of the earths rotation makes me.  I love you because you are whole and sane and so beautiful it hurts to touch you.  I love you because at night your sweet dreams move your body closer to mine  skin touching for days it seems.  I love you because when I wake next to you and the sun shines over our bodies  Mother Nature tells me this is the most natural thing I can ever have.  Human life is but a mili-second in the big picture so there is no time to waste.  In the morning you smell of sweet vanilla when I press my face into your neck.  Your breasts curving so gracefully  I watch the lines of your body and try to memorize them.  Your fingers so soft and strongnot to dainty and not to hard.  Its the kind of thing you wish for when you are single  or at least when I was single  and lucky enough I got what I wanted  no less and no more.  At night when you wrap your legs around me I almost melt.  Your sweet lips covering me like a cotton sheet of sweet desire.  True is your love for me. ,0

"  QRF (Quick Reaction Force) for those who are not in the military the job of QRF is to be the first responser to any threats happens on camp.  QRF night  like most of my QRF duty I spend hours looking at the night sky. QRF is lame and that shows you how much action this camp gets. Well Iraqi night sky is nice its almost as nice as the Hawai'i night sky. Of couse hawai'i is at a much higher location. The city just don't know what they are missing. I just wish I have a camra that could take picture of the stars so I could show it to people back home. As I lay on top of my hmmvv staring upward at the sky I easy counted hundreds of stars. However I wasn't bore enough to name them. Even thought I feel that they needed names. About an hour into endless staring I notice stuff are flying across the sky. They look like tracer rounds. I was like wow we are under attack. But hmm.... they look like they are 300 miles up in the air. Than I was like well they are shooting no were need us so I just watch the growing stuff flying 300 mile over me for 3 more hours. By the way I did see few huge growing flying stuff fly across the sky. That could of be a missile or a meteor burst. If its a meteor I am going to name it ""shooting cock shit"". ",0
  Here I am trying to download anime all night in this government computer. Somehow I end up losing 4 download that night. These computer is slow and it takes like an hour each. You know how much time jts wasted trying to fix this problem. The whole time I was thinking only if I have my own computers. While I am mad at these computer something horrorable was happening out side the camp. 20 mile south of here is the town of Najaf. Those crazy people was acting up all week  threaten to blow up oil line and stuff. So the US marine when down their and kill 300 militia. They got us here alerted of possible counter attack. The trouble they case us just made me want to go down their to joint the fight. I just hate wearing body armor to walk around the camp. ,0

  Did I put more into this than I should? Are my emotions getting the better half of me? Do you feel anything close as the way I do? Are you pulling away now? These are the questions that keep running around in my head. As the time grows closer for you to leave I am seeing you less and less. I think its four more days I have left with you. And then your gone not close enough for me to have and hold. I telling myself that I shouldn't be feeling this way. But  I can't help how I feel I guess. I think that's it  you took me off guard. I wasn't ready to meet someone like you. I'm truly glad that I did and I wouldn't change that for anything. Please know that I will be ok. That I will look on this as something pleasant in my life...and I need nice things in my life right now. I know I'm not losing you. We will still talk and see each other from time to time. I just wish it was more.... ,0
"  As my life moves towards things I don't want. I feel myself drawing inward into me. Closing myself off from the outside world. Becoming quieter and quieter..friends aren't acting like true friends...love that can't be had...because we can't do distance. Not sure where I'm going to live for a month. This adds up...this may be more than I can take. The love that's lost is the hardest to deal with. I can make new friends...I can find someone to take me in. I just want that feeling again..LOVE Its been too long from the last time. I've said I want a change in my life...to find someone I respect like I do you. To stop running through ""girls"". To let someone get in and be close to me. To push aside the walls and let them see the real me. ""To be love and to love some else"" Simple things if you just look at it typed out like that. Its another for it to actually happen. I go on the hopes of it will happen ""someday"". Someday seems too far too unknown. Is it wrong to to want that now? ",0
  HOLY CRAP BATMAN WHAT A CHAMPION!!!!   Who would have thought that my freakin theory on the damned thing was correct/!?!? 100% correct/!??!?! hahahahaha man i could streak right now!!!

  I took her out it was Friday night.I wore cologne to get the feeling right.we started making out and she took off my pantsbut then I turned on the TV.And that's about the time that she walked away from me.nobody likes you when you're 23 and are still more amused by TV shows.what the hell is a.d.d.?my friends say I should act my age what's my age again?what's my age again?Then later on  on the drive home.I called her mom from a pay phone.I said I was the cops and your husband's in jail.this state looks down on sodomy.And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me.nobody likes you when you're 23 and are still more amused by prank phone calls.what the hell is caller ID?my friends say I should act my age what's my age again?what's my age again?And that's about the time she walked away from me.nobody likes you when you're 23 and you still act like you're in Freshman year.what the hell is wrong with me?my friends say I should act my age what's my age again?what's my age again?That's about the time she broke up with me.no one should take themselves so seriously.with many years ahead to fall in line why would you wish that on me?I never want to act my age what's my age again?what's my age again?What's my age again? ,0
  I think of awhile ago we might have had it all.I was so stupid then you needed time to grow.But now just as things change as well my feelings do.in time things rearrange I am so sick of chasing you But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose.you make me regret those times I spent with you and playing those games as I wait for your call and now I give up  so goodbye and so long.It's not a change of pace this time I'll get it right.it's not a change of taste I was the one there last night.You have your other friends they were there when you cried.didn't mean to hurt you then best friends just won't leave your side.But what do I get 'cause I just seem to lose.you make me regret those times I spent with you and playing those games as I wait for your call and now I give up  so goodbye and so long.When I needed you most when I needed a friend you let me down now like I let you down then.So sorry  it's over!! ,0
  ON THE 4TH OF JULY I WENT TO GEAUGA       Lake. MAN I KICKED it MAN. MY SISTERS ARE SO SCARY. BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T GET ON THE X-FLIGHT OR THE BATMAN. SHE GOT ON CORNY RIDES LIKE THE TEXAS TWISTA. THAT RIDE WAS CRAZY BUT IT WASN'T NOTHING COMPARED TO THE X-FLIGHT  I MEAN YOU HAVE TO LAY  BACK ON THAT RIDE IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WAS GOING TO HIT THE GROUND OR SOMETHING. WE GOT ON ALL THE WATER RIDES  AND WE WAS IN THE WAVE POOL. A COUPLE OF PEOPLE  WAS DROWINIG. WELL GEAUGA lake DON'T GOT NOTHING ON CEDAR POINT. ,0

  One of my favorite animals is a dog. I like dogs because they are very playful and energetic. You can dogs real easy to me. You can treat a dog almost like a person. My favorite wild animal is  cheetahs. They are the fastest four leg animal on earth. But I wouldn't want to Have one of those for a house pet. This animal looks so lovable and you just got to have one. This animal is a tiger not just any tiger a white tiger. I really won't one of those. This is one animal I wouldn't won't to have this animal is a   MONKEY ! ,0
  I have a lot of friends! They are so crazy and cool to hang around. When I'm don't feel to right they make me feel right. Like my friend Chondera can have a bad attitude sometimes but  she cool.

  Well  yesterday I went to warped tour with my gay and lesbian friends from Kiel. I have to say that it was a rocking time. I got to see Story of the Year  which blew my fucking ass away. The pure energy that just flowed off of the stage and into every soul jamming at the concert was so intense. I really didn't expect much from the other bands that I saw  basically because I knew nothing of their musical endeavors. But I would have to say that Flogging Molly and Billy Talent really left a good impression on me. So good in fact that I decieded to download their music. Illegaly of course. It was the only way I could really show my appreciation towards them. Other than not being able to hear for most of the day  it went by pretty typical. Went to the farm for a while in the morning  came home  played a little Metroid on the JNES  and reffed a meaningless soccer game. Oh  and I created this incredibly awesome web blog. Yea  that's it. Until we meat again  Bacon out. ,0
  The day started like any normal day. Spent quality time with cow shit in the morning and then came home. But when I came home  I had the pleasure of trying to inform the soccer team of our game in De Pere that evening. That was an adventure. Called 10 people  left messages by all but 3. We ended up cancelling it anyway  thank God. So instead I went in my yard and kicked a ball around for a while just to pass the time because the Brewers are in the midst of a horrendous offense stretch. I actually caught Adult Swim tonight. Family Guy  Futurama  and Aqua Teen Hunger Force were all of good quality. So until something interesting happens  everyone who reads this will be forced to be as bored as me. But I'm assuming it'll only be Bob. Sorry Bob. I'll try harder tomorrow. Bacon out. ,0
  Today was the last day of Lakeland Music camp  and that's a bad thing cuz that means I don't get to see Mello for a long time. *Tear*. But we'll still see effort to see each other. I'm breaking the mold from all the other posts (2)  and I'm doing this bad boy in the middle of the day rather than at the end of one. I'm talking to Mello right now  and soon I'll be goin to the alumni football game  but that's to hear the alumni band. Should be fun. Maybe. Until we meet again  Bacon out. ,0
"  Dear my bathroom mirror  I've been roaming around in the empty street.  Coming home to an empty room.  Talking to an empty wall.  And afraid filling an empty glass.   I've been weird these days.  and more to that i've been turning my face around way too much.  So much it leads me to this question.  I really hope you can answer.   ""what is movin on  dear friend?""   What is it really?  Is it driving twice faster everytime you pass those places that have THAT memories?   Is it turning the radio off soonest you hear those songs that scream THAT memories?  Is it turning your car around close to home  just because the thought of finding yourself alone in an empty room becomes an unbearable thought.    Is it forcing yourself to be around people as much as you can  no matter how it kills your inside  and how you feel much emptier in the more crowded places.   Is it burning all the objects that has anything to do with THAT memories.   Is it asking your boss to give you more assignement  so that you can bury yourself in it  no matter how tired you are already. Just so you dont have to think about THAT memories.   Is it finding yourself in the arms of randoms strangers  and finding yourself in the more strange rooms with strange smells  among huffings and puffings from these stranger whom language you cant even understand  only to avoid those feelings resemblance to THOSE memories.    Is it not letting your glass run out of vodkas in those bars  where you can forget how awkward it is to dance with an empty feelings  and then fill your frozen stare with more vodkas  so that the most you would care about is not to fall face first.   Is it logging off twice faster than the lightning whenever you see him go online.   Is it saying you're fine thousand times to yourself.   Is it finding yourself putting on more make up than what you used to do  just so that you dont look pale.   Is it turning your face around twice as much whenever you see any guys walking with blue checkered shirt and cargo pants.   Is it numbing your feelings. Is it freezing your inside.  Is it killing who you were before and becomes a whole lot of different person.   Or Is it leaving this island?   What is it dear friend?  --------------------------   I love myself. I deserve better. I am moving on.  I will be okay.  I have valium now. ",0
"  In the year 2002  was my greatest regret ever. The only peson invoved and to be blamed is me. It was my fault that I did not I did not do well in my P.S.L.E. I was studying in Coral Primary school. There is where my problems started.      Firstly  I mixed around in the wrong group. I was new in Coral Primary as I had just transfered from Loyang Primary in the second month of 2000. In the beginning I thought it would be ""ok""  and the things I did were fun and I enjoyed it very much. I skipped the remedials I had every day to meet my friends in the car park. There I would spend hours to play with fire but I did not smoke. I did not pick up any bad habbits as I already knew they were to harm me. And when I went home I would tell my mum that i went for my remedials. I thought I would concentrate in my work as well as well as go out with my friends. But this did not happen. Instead I started avoiding studies. Soon  I started getting involved in more trouble and later on I started thinking that my friends were more important than my studies. When the time came  that was two years later in the year 2002  I wasen't ready. It was my P.S.L.E. It was now that I realised that my mistakes.        During my exams I went blank in my weakest subject  maths. The rest of the subjects were average. I started to panic as I knew I was going to get bad marks. In the end I did. I did very badly and got into a school I did not wnted  Siglap Secondary. At first I thought that I would do anything to get out  but as time passed  I became to know the school beter and realised it was a good place to learn in. But every where there will be ""this"" and ""thats"". There is no scholl that is perfect. Well  I was confused in what to do  I was lost but I knew that I had to adapt to it and strive to do my best. I was angry and dissapointed at myself on my mistake but I knew I had to let the past be the past. But not forget the past but learn from the mistakes. I learnt my mistakes and I know that I should not do it again. Now I have stuck this in my head that I should not mix around in the wrong company as the consequences would be unbearable and that I should pay attension in my studies. Now that I know the ""good"" and the ""bad"" and now I believe I can achieve my goal. ",0
  Sometimes I have a crazy notion that runs through my head.  It's actually more like a recurring question that puzzles me at odd times and places but usually when I see some otherwise taken for granted ingenious invention.  For example  it happened this past Sunday as I sat in an Emergency Room waiting area (a friend had been bitten by a dog...) as I watched the automatic sliding glass doors.  What a wonderful and convenient invention.  A sensor detects your presence and opens the door.  Then it hit me...What would Benjamin Franklin think of that?   I think of Ben and what he would think quite often when I hear the telephone ring  see airplanes in the sky or cars on the road.  Just the idea of electricity (that covers lights  the radio  television  motion pictures...The list is endless)  the concept of the internal combustion engine  the physics of flight...  Just think of how much fun it would be to tool around with Ben showing him all the things we've manage to create.  Can you imagine explaining how man has walked on the moon?  How would he react to hearing that we have a satellite circling  capturing data  recording it and reporting back to Earth from the planet Saturn?  We have come so far and have so much.  Ben would be very impressed with everything...   That's usually when another of my recurring thoughts hits me.  He'd be impressed with all the gadgets and inventions but eventually he'd see what kind of society we've become.  He'd be appalled by our lack of education in light of all the technological marvels.  Sure  it took a smart person somewhere to figure out the concepts of the new technology...But look what we've given up in return.  For all our efforts we have people that can't read and write...People that don't have or use their imaginations...People that can't think for themselves...People that are happiest doing no more than mindlessly doing nothing.  Our Great Society has become stupid  ill mannered  uncaring and lazy.  It's a shame really.  And I'm certain that Ben wouldn't like it... ,0
  YAY! We are refinancing our home! I just finished up my first week as a real time graphic designer too. Working at Trinity Lutheran College is really great. I love the fact that I have my own office. I put in a work order to have it painted and have some extra junk hauled out of there! So I can personalize it as I please.   On another note. I can't stand Keith the Freecycle South King County moderator. He is so annoying! It is like he only owns the group to rule over people to build his own ego it is so annoying.   Paul  Riley and I went to the Lincoln Park wading pool after work today. It got up to 92 degrees today so it was nice to get our feet wet. Riley really likes wading pools. We just walked around with her. Then we went and had dinner at Spuds and walked along Alki. ,0
  Paul  Riley and I had a nice weekend. Yesterday we went up to Bellevue to see Corey and Dan's new place. It is a big condo in the Renton Highlands. Her parents were over this way so we all went down to the Bellevue Arts and Crafts fair.   While there I completely mastered the art of breastfeeding Riley while walking with her in the sling. I love it! I don't even think anyone really knew what I was doing. Corey's dad even asked if she was sleeping.  So cool! I do need a new sling though. I think I am going to make one myself.   Today we all went to church. It was our seminarian  Kahn's  last day. So we went downstairs for doughnuts after mass. Then we came home and Riley was asleep so we did some marathon cleaning.   Robbin stopped by to say hi and reminded me of the heart fabric that she made Riley's curtains out of. (she gave me the excess). So I made Riley some cute pants. They are a little big and long now but she has a lot of room to grow into them. ,0
  Friday the thirteenth! I forget to post for weeks and I remember on friday the thirteenth.   Can I just say I am so sick of people being so against breastfeeding!!! What is wrong with doing something that my body is meant to do? I hate how formula companies have put the idea in people's minds that it is this amazingly great thing. UGH! ,0

I was pleasantly surprised when I found that out  we thought he was getting home Sunday. I'm not gunna be able to talk to him until Friday cause now he's on a cruise ship  unless he has service in Norway or where ever it is that he's going. I have an audition at the Legion Theatre in Cartersville this Saturday  I might not even go... but we'll see.

"  I'm sitting in a wading pool in Paul's backyard on a sweltering 100 degree day in Portland. Tomorrow I leave for the San Juan islands on a two week trip with 12-14 year olds. I am savoring every moment of relaxation I have in my thirty-six hours off  though it is always difficult to resist the call of the lengthening to-do list.  In college Cynthia and I were going to make a think tank called Brains in a Vat. We would lie around thinking and writing and solve the world's problems. Right now I don't feel like I have very many solutions to the world's problems  but if I could sit around all day and think I would surely come up with something phenomenal. The blogger address brainsinavat.blogspot was taken  which makes me wonder if someone else is usurping our idea. I had to take Brains in a Jar. Too bad. What will I do if they are conservative assholes using ""Brains in a  Vat""? Closed-minded  tightass brains in a vat. I bet their logo isn't as nice as ours. I can see it now: Brains in a Jar versus Brains in a Vat. Two thinktanks battling head to head for funding. I guess if they can solve the world's problems before we can  I should commend them.  Thirty-seven days left of my job. My mom suggeested that I count them down on my calendar to make the time seem more manageable. Thirty-seven days seems very far from manageable right now. I know I can do it and I know that I am helping them out by giving so much advanced notice  but some days I kick myself for not just giving two weeks notice like everyone else in America.  Paul's last day at work is July 31. I have guilt pangs about us both being unemployed at the same time because I know how that must look to our employers. I didn't quit my job to have time for Paul. I quit my job to have time for me. For my health. For grad school. For my future.  But they don't know that.  And it sure is going to be nice . . . ",0
  This has been a difficult year. Friends have moved away; health has been poor; job satisfaction slim to none. But changes are brewing . . .  I quit my job of three years. I need to move on and give myself time to heal. The transition will be difficult (for me and for the organization) but it's long overdue.  Maybe I need an outlet.  Maybe I need to write.  Maybe I'll do it here. ,0
"  Well...I could start this with ""who I am"" and ""why I am here""  blah  blah  blah.  But I will save that for another day.  I am an online diary/blog veteren so to speak.  I am starting a new one because too many people know me at the other one (I really think that in my cyber-saturated mind. How could they know me?  We've never met.)  Dammit I am going to be honest in this one  no playing for the audience.  I will warn you that I tend the blah  blah on about the negative.  So don't leave me posts about my damn negativity.  This is my house and my toys  go home if you don't like it.  And I am just going to start in the middle here so it probably will leave you saying HUH??             So Dan gets the car loan with grandma as the co-signer.  Then like 2 seconds later he decides to quit his job and move to Detroit and go to school.  Not a popular thing to do  and I agree.  He does have a new job lined up.  But him moving away and such gets grandma pretty nervous.  Fast forward to today....Sissy...I mean Mark (professional mamas boy) wants to come over and hang out with Brian.  I get home from work and he is already here...fabulous.  He's in the house maybe 15 minutes and he starts sticking his sissy boy nose into the Dan/Grandma/Car/Detroit business.  NONE OF HIS BUSINESS.  After a short time of this blah  blah I leave to room.  I want to keep myself from choking my brother in law....  ""Well my thing is....."" he says.  MY THING?  You don't have a thing...this isn't your thing.  Brian comes looking for me a little later after he got rid of Sissy.  He new exactly why I left the room (that why we are married 8-)).  He told sissy in no uncertain terms that if he came over to spy for his mother he might as well go home.   In fact (don't know what  happened to the freaking font)  he told him they had better drop it before he said something he would regret later and told him (Sissy) that he (Brian) can handle Dan and life at our house without his advice.  GO BRIAN!        So thats today.      Hope I get back here....hope I can find it.             peace ",0

"  Hi you  this is me. Me  this is you.  Now that introductions are over  I'm gonna give you a chance to get to know me. Don't screw this up  or yknow  nothing will happen. I think I should point out that this is my first blog ever. and it's something I decided to do on a whim at 8 o clock on a Sunday night after I basically got fired from my job.  Oh  did I pique your interest?  Well if I did  here's what happened. Yesterday  I called in and told them I would be picking up my two weeks notice  this got miscommunicated as ""Hey  I'm quitting right now"" and as I went in today  I was asked ""Didn't you quit."" Anywho  to make a long story short  I ended up in a mixture of quitting/getting fired.   Im fine with it  I have to start school in a couple week anyway.  But that's in the past  and Im sure no-one reading this is interested in my past  only what might future might hold  and exactly where my present lies.  So here's the present: I'm a guy. I have a girl. Me and said girl just got gerbils on Saturday. The gerbils names? Cactus Jack Daniels and Robin Hood  Prince of Thieves. They're outlaws! :)  I am unemployed as of today and going back to school in a couple of weeks. I've never been especially good in school  but not because I'm dumb. It's because I've never decided to go through the effort of doing anything in class  or at home for that matter. I guess that is pretty dumb. For what it's worth though  I ace all my exams.  The girl  y'know  the one I was telling you about before? The on with the gerbils  well  she is my love  and my everything. You'll definantly hear reference to her later in my blogging adventure.    I have just decided that I should change names to protect all of the people involved in my eccentric adventures  y'know  don't want to leave all their things laying about for their mom to find now do we?  I'll decide on names later  but i think the gerbils will get to keep their names as they are. For now however  Jack and Robbie are making a lot of noise  so  I'll post what I have and go attend to them  maybe I'll write something else later. ",0

"  I decided to make my own blog today.  I might have fun with it  editing the the template and all to the best of my abilities. (I don't know much HTML)    Yeah  yesterday was my birthday.  I turned 16.  I don't have a car  I'll be getting my license soon  though.  I went to Benihana's to eat.  It's a japanese restaurant where they prepare the food right in front of you with these cooking tables.  The food was really good  especially the fried rice.     A list of everything I got from friends and family:   - Kodak EasyShareCX7300 digital camera -Computer/desk chair -The Bourne Identity DVD -Hot Shots DVD -Naked Gun DVD -$60 -$22 -$20 gift card to the local media store (FYE) -A cut rock  it's really beautiful.  Came with a stand. -Two ""hoodies"".  I love ""hoodies"".   With the money I had I purchased:  -The Matrix: Revolutions DVD -Sealab 2021: Season 1 DVD -Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Volume 2 DVD -Snowboard Kids (video game) -Gun Valkyrie (video game) -Mad Maestro (video game)  That's about it for my birthday  oh yeah there was a good cake.  It's half yellow cake and half chocolate cake.  It's covered with vanilla icing  and there are some balloons.  It's really good.  Wow I just realized how dull this must be for people.  Well I thank anyone who takes time to read this stuff. ",0
"  Well I spent time with some of my many friends.  The people I hang out with most are Richard  Matt  and Zach.  Well they were over today  so we decided to go to the mall.  I LOVE music video games.  And I had been looking for a PS2 game called ""Rez"" for awhile.  Well  I found it today.  I found Rez at the mall media store called FYE.  It was $31.99 but it was well worth it  since it's an awesome and very rare game.  I also purchased a CD at FYE.  It's ""The Best of  The Church"".  I love the band  The Church  and this CD is great.  It has 17 songs on it  and I love all of them.  After the mall  we all came back to my house and played video games/watched funny things on the internet/listened to music.  I love spending time with my friends. ",0
  my wife just walked in and placed a big bag of pistachios on the table next to me... they are nice. I usually buy a handful when I go to play adnd with the guys  playing adnd is nice.. no actually it's awesome fun  very geeky  but hell what do I care! What matters more in the world than enjoying yourself with good friends? not much  that I can assure you. ,0
  I heard about a couple of jobs at work I applied for the other day. I didn't receive an interview. I'm pretty dissappointed about it  I thought my application was quite good... I was never expecting to get either of the jobs  there are people at work who definitely deserve them more than I but it is still a sensation not dissimiliar to a kick in the teeth. All my friends rallied around to make me feel better but of course when you feel like that there is very little someone can do to help. It's a matter of stewing for a few days and then getting over it  I am becoming a master this year it seems. I offered my application to my friends at work for there opinion  they all said it was pretty good  but I only got a truly honest opinion from one  my good friend anthony  he told me that while it was good  I used passive language which they warn you against  I really appreciate his honesty  you have to respect it. I think he might be one of those friends you meet rarely that you should try and hold on to for the rest of your life.. you can't waste a good friend. I actually feel the bunch of guys I've met in the last couple of years while working where I am  are the best I have ever made  they are not like some of the friends I had in high school who seem to use when appropriate and forget you at other times and I honestly don't think they ever thought about it  or the friends they are unwilling or just unable to share any emotions deeper than a bottle of beer with you.. at some point you must grow up.  I was told by Anthony the other day when he read this for the first time that adnd is an old acronym for Dungeons and Dragons dating back to 2nd Edition and that die-hards upon reading my first post would pick me up on it... and I have to say if that is so  then you really must start doing something more than dnd with your life  okay! I love the game  but really! ,0
"  I have been thinking a lot lately.  Many ""what if's"" have crossed my mind.  Should I leave them as ""what if's""?  Or should I follow my heart and find out?  I hope the big guy can give me a sign or two.  He never fails me in that department. ",0
  I want...  A silver pocketbike because they're so rad.  A Hurley surfboard & a roundtrip ticket to Hawaii so I could use it there.  A Hattori Hanzo sword to slice mofo's that annoy me in half.  And of course  I want world peace :). ,0
"  Okay  so maybe I'm not employee of the month.  But when it's time to work  I work hard.  It's quite annoying when a particular person sees that there is stuff to be done  but chooses to stare off into ""la-la-land"" instead.  They should thank their lucky stars I'm not their superior because they'd be canned on the spot if it were up to me.  You know what's weird?  When you see little kids you used to babysit back in the day  all married with kids.  No one wants to enjoy the single life anymore huh?  God dammit  that just means I'm freaking old.  Maybe I am past the finish line?  Skurrry. ",0
"  It sucks to see someone you love be so stupid!  But I can't criticize because I too was an idiot in the past.  I guess it IS true that the people outside of your little ""love bubble"" can see the flaws of one of the persons in the relationship.  I hope to God I'm never ever that dumb! ",0
"  Maybe I'm too nice  but it would be hilarious to bust someone out when they are yapping on and on about nothing but lies.  It's the same bullshit over and over again.  Save your saliva.  No one wants to hear it anymore.  It's old.  It's lame.  And most importantly  nobody's impressed.  Obviously they've never heard of that ghetto phrase  ""you ain't gotta lie to kick it.""  And yes  I'm somewhat of a bitch.  Tell me something I don't know already. ",0
  After much encouragement from my tech-savvy boyfriend  Ive decided to get on board with the concept of blogging. As a writer  it only makes sense that I find an outlet to document my thoughts. However  I still kinda feel like Doogie Houser at the end of an episode when he would type a couple of sentences on his old school computer to both sum up his day and offer some sort of introspective look at the universe. Remember how he would always pause right before the last few words? That lame theme music would play as he contemplated the perfect vocabulary to capture the essence of his experience. And then he would always type the last couple of words r-e-a-l-l-y s-l-o-w-l-y. I guess that was a primitive form of blogging.   I still find the concept of putting your thoughts out for the world to read intimidating and intriguing. I mean  why would anyone care what I had for breakfast or thought of a movie I had recently seen? I guess its just like having a diary  but how personal can a blog get if you know everyone can read it? Regardless  I feel that writing for leisure again instead of just for work will be a positive experience for me. ,0
  Ive started attending this yoga class at the Fitness Center on Wednesday nights. I figured it would be a good way to gain more flexibility & strength. I have to admit  its a lot harder than I anticipated and that kinda pisses me off! Here I thought it would be a nice break from my regular workout routine in the middle of the week. I'm pretty flexible and since its not straight-up cardio  I assumed it would be easy.  Not so much. Its actually pretty challenging to continually switch  ; hold all of those poses. And it turns out Im not as flexible as I thought I was. Im particularly horrible at the balancing portion of the class. I look like I stopped off somewhere for happy hour before showing up. However  I do enjoy the challenge so I plan to keep going. I just know it will take some time before I feel any sort of euphoria from it. ,0
"  What would you do if an ex came by the house  you are with a new person and that person is SO upset that they might leave you?  So upset at the fact that he doesn't want to talk to you  kiss you  or touch you.  You tell him not to worry about the ex  you wouldn't do anything to destroy your relationship with them. They are your first true love  never find anyone better than them. But still  they are so mad  rub it in your face that you were even with that person. Will make love to you but right in the middle all the heat disappears and cant finish. You say its ok  everything will be ok  but its not. I can understand what he is going through  although not sure I would take it so far. I tell him this  still no help. I tell him that he is my world  my best friend  my everything. I could never want a man as much as I want him...But still no help. The relationship already has a ton of troubles..Kids  work  money  his ways  my ways..Average things. But when you add the fact that he doesn't trust you  to the point that he makes himself sick  what do you do?  Get to the point that they are treating you badly as to block the pain if you do hurt them...Does that really help? Or does it make it worse? You don't like to be treated badly  you where in a relationship that was like that for 6 years  you thought that this person would be different  treat you like a queen. But when they get like this  what do you do? Deal with it until it makes you a bitch? Resentful  hurt  angry.......       They realize that they did you wrong  but the damage is done  the hurt will never go away. How many times can you hear ""Im Sorry"" before you realize that its a easy way out. That ""Im sorry"" doesn't cut it anymore. If they were sorry they would stop doing it repeatedly and change their ways. Maybe they are sorry  but can they really be if they say it so many times and not do anything about the way they are acting? ",0
  NP:  Axel Rudi Pell - Legions of Hell  Well  this marks my first blog entry. My track record generally isn't too good with these things  when it comes to updating them  but  eh. What the hell.  Anyway  went job hunting today. Not very promising. Probably gonna suck in my pride and try Walmart on wed. Anything is better than I have now. I have tried for them in the past. Hope my luck shall be different this time.  I will be putting my Resume' online at hmas.org in the near future if anyone reading this wants to check it out and hire me ;)  -Reno ,0
"  Man will this rain ever stop. Two days straight now  it has been raining. Pittsburgh must be a swamp  by now...  WWE RAW was a good show last night. My first wrestling show live. The Battle Royal was really cool  the Triple H/Chris Benoit 60 minute Iron man match was spectacular. The highlight of the evening however...  THE FLAIR FLOP  Yes... I have finally seen Ric Flair get the shit kicked out of him... pause in the corner... walk forward... stagger a little and fall forward flat on his face... IN PERSON! My life is complete. Hot crowd  great action  although we did chant ""Here we go  Steelers!"" during the Iron Man match. Us Pittsburghers... class ALL the way! ",0

  You know  I tried posting one of these twice in the last week and both times it didn't come up  so this will be the third time. If you are able to read this  then you know that it worked. if not... well blogger can fuck off and I'll go back to livejournal (or better yet start my own blog).  Anyway  tomorrow is the opening of insidepulse.com. It'll be nice to be able to read columns by my net god  Hyatte again. A week without him is like a week of not being able to jerk off. Passionless  boring  and all together unsatisfying. Now I can have a mental orgasm all over myself. Should be fun. Welcome back Cool Hy  you fucker.  Well  that is all I can think of. Now. If you'll excuse me  I plan to go stuff my face with Hostess Cupcakes. I can put a BOX away and I don't gain a pound  you bitches!!!!!!!  Reno ,0
  So...I just got back from shopping with Keeley.  It was so much fun because we decided almost everything that we were going to buy for school  but it kind of sucked ass because we only had twenty each.  I still managed to get a really cute shirt from Old Navy.. but it's kind of see through... oh well!  I'm just going to haev to look a little sleazy! Hahaha! Well  yet again  I have nothing more to write. ,0
"  So...this is my first entry in my blog.  I've had blogs before  but I seem to never update them...and then I forget what the website is to my blog.  Hopefully I'll update this one.  So  my name is Tiffany  I live in Virginia Beach  and I'm going to be a sophomore at Princess Anne High School in September.  I am a Madrigal in my school's chorus  which is supposed to be an honor  but it really isn't.  My best friend is Keeley.  She is so awesome and is just like me; we met at the beginning of the school year  when she moved here from San Diego.  Which is kind of funny because that is where I was born.  We were very lucky this year to go traveling together with our school.  We are both drama geeks and got to go to a thespian conference at Longwood University and we also got to go to New York City  which was absolutely amazing.  After going to New York I decided that I am going to move there when I get out of high school.     Anyways... I am currently in a production of the play Twelfth Night by Shakespeare.  It has been such an amazing experience and I have made some great friends.  First there's Matt... he is so sexy  talented  and fun to be around  but unfortunately he is gay.  Then there's Sam... he is also sexy  talented  and fun to be with  but he has a girlfriend who he is absolutely in love with.  Rebekkah  who is almost exactly like me  is so much fun to be with...""She kills me!""  Unfortunately  we only have three more performances and then it's all over.    Well that's all I really have to say right now.... but I'll right more later. ",0
  why the hell can't I get a damn doctor or dentist appointment withing this century.  Is there this much of a shortage of doctors.  I have serious problems here (but not enough of an emergency to call an ambulance) and nobody can see me because they are all booked till november or some crap.    Now that I got that out... first entry in this log just so happened to be after calling multiple doctors and dentists to find that we seem to have a shortage of them.  Well  I gotta get back to work now... setting up this blog was my waiting on hold task... time for some real work. ,0
"  My boss has this rule about being late for work... don't be.  One minute late warrents a call to him to tell him you will be one minute late for work.  I once got yelled at for being 4 minutes late to work... I come from a different world than this.   My older boss' at the same company didn't know what ""late"" meant unless it was for a meeting.  I work on the road a lot  and there it's do your work till you are done  like my 24 hour day of work the other week.  Where my old boss' knew this and considered it fine to do what we like when we are in the office (I used to get in between 9 and noon  and leave between 1 and 5... sometimes being from noon to 1pm).  Now I get ripped from that into a 9am start time... and here is the kicker... I still have to work till my work is done so it's not 9 to 5... it's 9 till done as long as done comes at 6 or after.  I don't understand this frame of thinking.  I need some flexibility in my time when i'm at work in the office considering I have long hours every time i'm on the road  I don't think it's too much to ask for... but the boss says no.  Well i'm rambling a lot... basically I was pretty damn late today and even though I was doing work from home my boss still had a ""talk"" with me about alarm clocks and asked me if I was doing smack last night and the such.  Luckily he can't get rid of me right now because i'm too valuable an asset.  Who thinks I should just f with him and come in late all the time to see if I can cross the line?  PS still haven't done any work that I couldn't have done from home yet. ",0
  Ok  so I set this up to reply to my friend Derek's blog and now I feel compelled to write something. All right  that is a lie... this is the first page it popped up to after setting up my account (again in order to respond to Derek) and I'd hate to have an empty blog and make it seem like I have nothing to say.    Big news of the day: today is the day my condo goes on the market. Yup  after over a year in glorious Chelmsford  I have decided to pack up and move back down to the Boston area. With the exception of Derek  all my friends live walking distance to the T and I count the number of times people have driven up to visit me on one hand. Ok  maybe 2  but definitely no toes! I guess I bought the place hoping to settle down there in the near future with my then beau  but things change and you need to accept that and move on  right? Hey  I may even make a profit off of it. I would accept a $20 000 mistake ;-) ,0
  I was at a wedding in NH this past weekend  and I can't help but wonder how many more weddings I will attend before I myself get married. I'm not dating anyone currently  but this getting married thing seems to be catching on like wild fire. Not that I am opposed to it. In fact  when I was in my last major relationship  I was pushing for it myself. But why? Did I think he was the one? Well  it did cross my mind  but I just saw him for the first time since we broke up on Sunday (after the Sat. wedding) and it is amazing to see how far we both are from that now. Does it make sense to get married when you don't know what you yourself want out of life? I'm starting to realize that the answer to that last question is 'no.' So  I don't think I am going to go looking for a husband any time soon  since I need to figure out my own path first.... but I must say  it is difficult to sit there by yourself and witness all the couples planning their weddings knowing how far off you might be. That must be a girl thing though! ,0
  Francis is my name  and i am a beginner bassist. Trying my best to practise for my one a biggest dream! That is to form a band with my friends. We target english rock  though i myself prefer chinese and jap rock. But through my friends' persuation  I decided to try it out. It's hard to enter the english rock market  cos nevertheless  white skins hate the yellow skinned  thus therefore they will definitely not support. Without the white skinned market  it's hard  god damn hard.     Ok  enough of my dreams  now to introduce myself further. I am a 17 year old chinese boy  sporting black short hair  little funky hairstyle  i'll try and post my pictures later. I'm not studying  cos i need to work for money to fuel my dreams. I'm around 1.7 to 1.74 metres tall  about 55 kg. I like to sing  play soccer  snooker  use the computer  slack  smoke  do nothing but dream all day long. I play the bass and I like to go shopping around with my friends.     I'm new to the blog stuff  so if anyone can help out  please do so by mailing me at  urlLink dreamz@pure-fm.net . Thnx alot.     About today  its my off day at work  so i've been slacking at home  and also practising my bass. Doesn't get anywhere better. Met up with my friend to discuss about our songs. currently  we've produced 4 songs of our own. Not too bad for a start. Got really excited and we discussed our plans to get more attention from the public. How we intend to let the public know us. Haven't found a name for our group  and we only consists of 3 people. A guitarist  a bassist and a perfect drummer. He's the best! Haha. Basically  thats all we've got. We're looking for a good male vocalist  or even a second guitarist. Anyone with music talent and wanna be in a rock band  willing to share expenses  ups and downs and experiences  can mail me too. I'll arrange a meet up. No harm trying ryte? Ok  Thats about it. I'll update more later. Bye! ,0
"  Ok. Frusterated? Yes. Why? B/c this is like the third time I am trying to post someting on this site.   Blog. So  if you look at dictionary.com  you can see that Websters had already included a defintion for the word blog. I have only recently only heard the word blog. I can't believe it's already in the dictionary. Wonder if it will also be in printed dictionaries  or just an online one.   So  thanks to my ubergeek sis and some other friends who attend nerdrus lawschool  I am now aware of the relatively new phenom of blogging. Courtesy of Mac. I love my mac. Mac is to a PC as a Manolo Blahnik's are to Payless. That's just the way it is.   All right  going to see what happens with the ""blog."" It will turn out one of two ways. Either  I will continue to bore whatever readers somehow happen upon my site. This will be the result of intolerable lectures I will feel better spent in a stream of conciousness. Option 2 -- I get bored of blogging  and forget about it for a while. By the time I think I'd like to give it a go again  I have forgotten my username and password  and am SOL.   Stay tuned to see which way the cookie crumbles. ",0
  ok  is this working???? All right  I think I may be doing it right. Is this bold. ?? I don't think bold is working. Let me look in preview. Nope. WTF. I am so glad that no one actually reads this. What a completely frusterating process. I can't figure out how to do anything on this site besides post titles of my current blog  and yes  I AM A LAW STUDENT. Whatever. F off. You would be confused to. It may be b/c it's almost 1:30 in the morning and I shopped like Paris today. Whee! Oh  woe is me  shopped myself delerious. Isn't life grand? I think it is. Shannon thinks it's better. I'll let you ask her why. Okie dokie  absolutely nothing to say  just typing b/c I have obsessive compulsive disorder and no one else is awake to talk to me. No one really is on instant messenger either  so I am sitting here giving myself arthritis b/c I had a diet coke too late and have to do something to keep busy. Some read Shakespeare  I am aimlessly blogging. What is this world coming to? I'm outie. ,0
  This is my first time using blogger........i didn't know how to change the page.......so.....i got this page which is so........ :(....... Never mind   This page is everything about....yaaaaa me..........quite boring but i don't have anything on now...so i did this blog.....   I go to school like everyone but not quite similar like everyone.......i meet alot of difficulties in school and alot that i don't know what to do with them.....one musn't avoid it but....it's so hard to do that......therefore  i had to think of stupid things that solves some of the problems but....not all....of course...   Everyday i come to school....i have to pull a long face.....keep happy all the time when i know that some of them don't like me......i'm not going to say their name but i'm going to give them nicknames.....let me think......Ah...one will be called......linky.......i don't really like her but she always comes to eat with me when i don't really like to her......and the other is...... biggy and she's by good friend...and i normally hang out with them.....biggy and linky......    Now....they are my friends.......but...i don't really like them alot and especially linky and don't ask me why and how.....   Let's see......i like to eat stuffs like potato chips and others.....i don't really actually know what i like to eat actually........But....i do hope to have the time to write in my blog because i do need to study hard to keep up with others....... Next time i write again in my blog....i hope to write more about myself and this blog i'm writing.......i have to keep it away from that linky especially because she will definitely make comments about me which is very depressing and she is so proud of herself........always think that she's better that anyone.....likes to listen to.....Jay Chou...what's the big deal with that guy anyway? The problem with linky is that she likes to make fun of others and especailly me.....She's such an idiotic girl that i hate her to the core....but i put a strong front in front of her lah......she make me angry and the next day...i'n still angry but i still have to be happy because if i'm still angry with her...she will call me petty.....she even call me a freak....she's the real freak man......share drinks with   other people and   even man.......i'm not saying that's illegal but...she do it soooo often...   Aiyah...got to go......need to study....... ,0
"  You wanna know why this girl looks how she looks?  Well this poor little girl was forced by me to talk with me  for more than an hour.  Hmm you wonder why I did this?  Well lets start with the background  Since Simon (a class mate of mine) invited us to a grill party  this became a tradition. The photo was taken at such a party and me being very drunk started  to talk to every girl telling her such great things like  ""You're the horniest in our gradates!"" or ""You can run but I'll  always find you""  Well for this not being embarassing enough I looked for a victim I can talk to for longer time  well there she was!  This time I was in love with a chubby cheeked girl named Karen. Luckily my ""conversation partner"" was the best friend of her. So the conversation was only about how Karen and I match together.  You can imagine that me being very drunk said things  which I had better not said.  Finally I can only say that I don't remember all the stuff I told her  but my opinion about relationships and what is important in such relationships were the best things I told her  because now everybody knows what a horny  guy I am with my 17 years.  Well this evening seemed to be a turning point of my imagination for a  relationship with Karen  because later she wanted to clear some things  between me and her. This resulted in a telephone conversation for about nearly two hours. The only thing I can conclude from this session is that she is an ecological cunt  who thinks that she is something better than others.  One reason  which lets me conclude so is that a friend of her told me that Good-naturedness was the only reason why she talked to me.  Well I didn't knew that every person  who talks to me is just good natured. I don't think that conversation is a thing of Good-naturedness  because if so the world will get egoistically and it will become a privilege to talk to someone else.  Sorry but here it seems that sombebody stayed too long in the broad sunlight. Maybe she planted too many patches  which is what she does right at the moment :D  This is it for now  I hope you enjoyed reading this and I hope I could give you a small view of my life.  Greetz ",0

"  Last night Jerry Douglas came to town and played a free concert. That guy is SO GOOD. He made me want to learn to play the dobro. And the best part was that his fiddle player had a mohawk. It was kind of like the whole band was saying  ""Even though we play bluegrass instruments  we're WAY beyond bluegrass."" They even had the same bass player as Nickel Creek. I wonder if that guy goes around joining bluegrass bands and then turning them into non-bluegrass bands. Or maybe in this case it was Jerry's idea. Maybe he got too sick of bluegrass from playing with Alison Krauss. Well it was a really great concert  nonetheless. ",0
  Well I think I know what my problem is. I'm not opinionated enough to own a blog. I'm totally indifferent about almost everything  so I can never think of anything to write.  Maybe I'll just write about what I did last night. Ben and I went to the park with his aunt  uncle  and cousins to watch a Tongan brass band play. We ate chicken from Sugarhouse Barbecue and it was so yummy. I don't know what their secret is  but their chicken tastes just like camping. Then the plan was to go back to the cousins' house to have brownies and ice cream and play Halo  so I asked to be dropped off at home because I didn't want to stay up all night. Plus I don't enjoy video games very often. Well they opted out of playing Halo because they wanted me to come have ice cream with them  so I went  even though I hate it when people change their plans for me. It makes me feel whimpy. So anyway  you might think that means we got home at a reasonable hour  but we still ended up staying there until midnight. I don't know how those guys (Ben's cousins/aunt/uncle) can stay up so late all of the time and still get up at 6:30 to go to work. It's hard for me! For some reason  as soon as I graduated from college  I turned into an old fart who has to go to bed on time. Totally lame.  Well it looks like I have a little bit of an opinion after all...at least about people changing their plans for me and going to bed on time. Who knew? ,0
  Well this is my time writing a blog. I feel kind of scared expressing my feelings to everyone. Well anyway  today i read The House on Mongo Street a very interesting book. It made me think a lot. about many things. how some people have dreams and goals and are destined to accomplish there goals. My goal in life is to be a good muslim and have good morals. I have been so confused lately about so many things in my life I feel as though i need to go out and see the world more and go and discover my self and find out who I really am. I feel so lost and tangled. I feel as though I need to become a person of my own do what i like and not just do whatever everyone else tells me to do. I also need to become a more confident person every step or decision i make in my life i feel as though something wrong may happen i need to mature and be myself. The other day i was speaking to my brother-in-law and i was just talking to him and telling him how ive wanted to do accounting my whole life and he said that i was not capable of doing so ofcoarse he was joking because he laughed later...but that made me think that some people think of me as if i am immature i dont know how to prove to everyone that im not that little girl anymore. i am the youngest out of 5 girls. In a way i am very happy and thankful of allah that i have 4 sisters a mom dad and 3 brother-in-laws who look out for me. but sometimes i feel as though i need a little privacy i dont always want someone to be there watching every step i take i need to learn from my experiences and in order to experience i need a little space. which i feel as though im not getting. im not sick of anyone i love my family from the bottom of my heart and i want them to be there for me all the time and i am there for them 100% whenever they need me  no doubt  but now a days i just want to go out and experience the world. When i say experience the world i mean i wanna be able to hang out with my friends more often not only in school but out of school. i wanna be able to go to Florida to my sisters place by myself without my sister bushra being with me. i want my parents to see that im not a little baby anymore. but because i have rules that i have to fallow i cant do all of this. anyway thats enough for now im so tired right now im gonna go to bed....peace out! ,0

  Hey Im Doug  for those that don't know me Im Raul's brother for those that don't know Raul Im a pretty kool kid;thats why I named this blog Kool Kids Blog.   Well since I just Introduced myself  I will you a few thing about myself.   Im fifteen years old and Im going to NDSS(North Delta Senior Secondary) in september.   Can't wait to attend High school  it's going to be so kool But Im still kinda nervous to be a little kid again.   When I was in Junior high I was in grade 10  I thought I was the king of the school;everyone thought I was kool I had the koolest friends and I had supuriority over the little Grade 8's and 9 s.    But since Im going to   Grade 11 Im going to become inferior to the Grade 12's not to mention the other Grade 11's.   Basically what Im trying to say is that I will have to make a new image of myself make new friends make new enemies.   Most kids in my class barely passed Math10 this school year I can't imagine how hard Grade 11 math is.   Im going to take Band in Grade 11 I was the best Trumpet player in my school but I know next year Im going to have tough competition  which kinda sucks because I had the worst band teacher this year.   Ms Robinson  the worst band teacher ever;she held me back so much that Im going to have to practice really hard for next year STUPID TEACHER.   Ms Robinson  tried to teach me and my friends to play guitar even though she DOESNT KNOW HOW TO PLAY GUITAR.   Last year Mrs Lucas left band teacher position she was the best teacher ever;she let us play good music but then Ms Robinson filled in for her and she made us play crappy music.   My friends hated her too  o-well.   My friends think Im on drugz but I don't know why I think my lack of sleep might make me look like Im on drugz.   Im tired of typing Im going to take a nap or something  so if you want to talk about stuff then add me to your messenger at  urlLink Gangstar41145@hotmail.com  or  urlLink Mr_mcneil_32@hotmail.com  .   Have a nice day. ,0
  I had my first day at work and it was cool i think i might keep it for a while. I hope i do it is cool. well life is cool  theres no school. i want a pool. Life is cool. my band is finally complete. YAYA!!!!! WELL I AM GOING TO END NOW BYE BYE PEOPLE OUT THERE!!!! ,0
  Today i found out that i had a job  and that i start that same day. It was great news  and all but i was supposed to do some things. I am alright because it brings me one step closer to being a more sucessful racer. So i guess it is a good thing. BYE BYE for now. ,0
"  In the past few days my life has changed so much. First i stayed at my friend Pauls house and by the time i left i had a GF. The story goes: I had been begging her to go out with me  she finally agreed to go out with me. I was so happy  and as it turns out i was her first kiss. It was great. She is the greatest thing to happen to me in a while. She is beautiful and i don't think she believes it. But she is. She has surprised me so much since i have known her. When i first met her my thought was ""Man she is beautiful"" I also thought ""I am going to get her if its the last thing i do"". I knew i had to have her. And now we are going out and her mom doesn't know! Not that we think she would get mad though i am sure she would  but we want to give it time. I want to be able to stay there a few times before i am not allowed to. I am sure that it might backfire at us but its a danger i am willing to conquer when it comes. Well its been 4 days since i asked her out  and i think it is going great. I got to spend time with her while i was there  and we had quite a bit of fun. But that is our business. She really did surprise me. She really is a great kisser  she can always get me going. I haven't told her that  but everytime she kisses me  i get a hard on. I guess she will know now! Well i am going to end this message here  thanx for taking the time to read this. I will sign out here. CASPER ",0
  Isn't it strange how well life is going perfect yuo never take time to thank God for everything that you have  but then the second you lose something you either blame it on God or beg him to give it back  or when you do have something you want u go to God and ask him to do it all for you. Isn't it strange how when u have alot of friends to talk to you dont care about the people who mean most to you  but then when you lose all your friends you try and turn back to the ones who care about you even though you ignored them and treated them like jerks. Isn't it strange that the things you seem to hate most in life are the things that will help your life  like doing math homework  or getting grounded for failing a science test that u didnt study for to begin with. Isn't it strange how sometimes your worst enemie becomes your best friend  and your best friends sometimes become your enemies. Isn't it strange how when someones so happy with the thing they have you start to get jealous insted of being happy for them  then start to want something just because someone else has it. Isn't this just all so strange? ,0
  When I think about everything you put me through and all the heart break you caused me  I wonder why I ever thought I loved you. And I wish I never knew the real truth.   You made me smile and frown  laugh and cry  you even made me happy when sad. Cheered me up every way  and even yet didnt stay. Why have I gone so far as to find the truth. Now I wonder how I let this pass me by without ever giving a good cry.   You never held me  never kissed me  never showed me how you felt. And yet deep down still always believed you. Until the day I woke up to find it not to be a dream  but all the heart break to be true.   You made me crash  then said so sorry. Broke me once  tiwce then once more again. You shoock me too me never to go back. Playing along with every little song  never thinking or caring how I would get over it.   Heart broekn  heart taken  heart never given back. I hit my head against the wall while I wonder what I ever did wrong to ruin what I thought we had  and about something I know I'll never get back.    I know you messed me up bad  but why do I feel like I'm still getting punished for your mistakes?! ,0
  Wouldn't it be sad if from the time we were born we knew exactly where we would end up in life? I personally don't believe in fate  but it might just be because I don't want to think that I don't have control in the outcome and direction of my own personal life. I enjoy being able to think that if I wanted to  I could completely change everything  and nothing would be predetermined.  But at the same time I can't help but wonder if my life will end up the same way no matter what. ,0
  Wow that is quite an idea to ponder.  It gave my liver a huge ego boost but then was immeadiatly shut down by my heart reminding it of the beating it will take during college. ,0
"  I mean  I *heart* marching band!  That reminds me of the cadaver book I read and it posed the thought of what if humanity still thought the spiritual center of the body was the liver.  It would be like ""I *liver sign* marching band!"". ",0
  Holly is the biggest bitch helping with band this year.  She can wipe my butt with her tounge....damn life's a bitch. ,0
  School starts in two days.  I just can't believe that.  It's like I've not even had a summer.  I'm excited because (1) I'm a junior and (2) I *liver sign* learning!  And Mrs. Bovender is simply awesome.  And as excited as I am I'm also not really looking forward to working myself to death.  But it's encouraging to think by the end of this year I'll know Calculus  and high-level chemistry  and be fluent in Latin  and know more about the history of the United States than I ever wanted to know  and be able to write an incredible essay in a short period of time....not to mention play a piano concerto. :)   Gah the PSAT is soon too.  I had this grand idea of me making like 2000 flashcards and learning all the words but I'm so tired right now.  I have to read my other book this weekend as well...which I haven't even started on.  Life is just too complicated sometimes...having to juggle schoolwork and music and social things. ,0
"  I was having a relatively average Friday at work when I decided to step outside for a fresh dose of nicotine and a butt scratch. As I was revelling in the sensation of my fading itch I noticed a flock of geese flying overhead. Inevitably the lead goose (I like to refer to the leader as ""the big cheese"") was cut down by a nudist pole vaulting midget (sorry  ""small person"" [I really like the brackets today]). As the two came crashing to the ground in a whirling pile of blood  puss  ; soft white bird feces I had a rather embarrasing moment of my own. A horrid scent tickled my senses. It was the kind of scent one doesn't pick up from a big cheese and a small person colliding 40 feet in the air. No  this scent was a little closer to home. Only after I felt the squishiness between my lower cheeks did I realize what had taken place. Some form of monsterous human being must have stolen my pants right off my body while I was distracted by the mid air catastrophy. This foul being then made doo-doo in my brand new Tazmanian Devil boxers before carefully placing them back on my body. A change of shorts and a roll of toilet paper later I began my hunt for the elusive undergarment defiling creature. Armed with only a plastic fork and a half burnt cigarette I patrolled the nearby streets for nearly half an hour when it hit me. Perhaps some of the other lower to middle class working folk in the area had been violated by the underpants bandit. I went to my truck and grabbed my CSI kit I ordered off the net. It arrived last night  just in time for me to uncover the mystery of the soiled ginch. Unfortunately I was unable to find any evidence outside of my own underpants. There didn't seem to be any eye witnesses either. Maybe they had been paid off or were just too afraid to talk. The bandit must have got to them.      This journal entry was not influenced in any way by any sort of illicit substance. I don't need drugs to be crazy. ",0
  The typical debate exists between the chicken and the egg. The question I am compelled to ask is on the level of the chick/egg  but has far more substance. So  what came first  the dude or the ness? The chicken does not exist without the egg  nor the egg without the chicken. The dude and the ness however can exist as separate entities  but combined  they are Dudeness. 'nough said. ,0
  There is a group of boys i had always en vious  some of them is in my class. Their releationship had been so close  u can always see them hanging out together during recess  after school anytime. Even if they quarrel they will patch back in a few days and their friendship will still be the same as before or even better. They had the kind of friendship that i always dream of but their friendship is being tested again and i think it is reaili bad this time. I hope here that they will get though this too as it wasn't easy to find friends that thinks alike. ,0
"  Ya we won a friendly match today it was against bedok police basketball team. It was a great match  whenever we score they will also return it. And the score was always so close not more than 6 i think  both team are having a hard time trying to score but because they were taller and bigger in size so we reaili had a hard time fighting for the rebound. Sad because of today's match i was injury again got elbow by 1 of them but he did't do it purposely so i did't mind it. Anyway i like this kind of match most  it was so fun to have evenly match opponent. ("" ) ",0
  Currently I am preparing for my 'N' level exam. My school's prelim had started today and I have taken my English & Maths paper 1. Study Social at mac for the whole le but felt tat nothing has gone in haix... sad man what mi i going to do.... ,0
  Sad! My friends told mi tat I had help a guy who was out to take advantage of gals  the guy is a classmate and a friend of mine althought I wasn't close to the gal but he wanted mi to put in good words for him as my friends had told the gal negitive comments about him. I helped him cos I felt that he was true to mi and was a worthy  friend  to help but that was only a point of view of mi of a guy so i'm not sure about others (mostly the gals)  I also donnoe about his past about his relationships wif other galfriends so I did't made much comments about him on tat. Anyway i don't reaili care about others past as whats past has past and what's important is now and the future so i placed my trust on him .  From what I had heard I think tat the gal is not mutual enough to start a relationship... ,0

"  To expand a little on my previous thought.           I spend about 95% of my free time alone.      I am engaged to my childrens father. This is the 3rd time we are engaged.    He wanted to elope  but I feel I deserve a wedding after all that I've been through. We live in different places. I  with the children at my parents house  and him with his mother and family.        His mother had a kidney transplant in December. I understand that he wants to be there for her. But my children and I suffer greatly.  He never comes around. When he does  she (or his sister) calls and he leaves.        Sometimes I think she exaggerates her pain (maybe I sound a little selfish) or maybe exaggerate isn't what I mean. I think she tolerates her pain until she wants attention. I feel bad for her because she suffers alot. But at the same time. I never get to see my ""fiance""   my kids never get to see their father.     There is a house down the street from her. And the people want around $700    monthly for a 3 bedroom house.  He decided (without me even seeing it) that it wasn't good enough because the house is blue  fiends (drug addicts)   lived   there  and the kitchen is yellow. He can't see taking us from where we are now to move there.        He lives in a 3 bedroom house with about 6 people and a dog. I live in a big 4 bedroom house with my parents  and I am cramped. My son doesn't like to stay here because he thinks my parents don't like him.  My daughter has to stay upstairs with me  because they yell about the house being dirty. She doesn't like it there much either. But he doesn's see moving us from here  because of a freakin yellow kitchen.       I haven't been able to sleep or really eat since he told me this last night.  If anyone can give me a honest opinion on what's really good  I'd really appreciate it. ",0
  Picture my life.      I picture my life  the epitome of happiness.    A dream  a house  a car.   A yard  Two kids  a puppy.    A happy life with my husband.

A disappointment after another with a commitment phobic.   Parents downstair  yelling and screaming.      Picture my life. ,0

  Well this is my first  my first step on the highway known as blogging. Not going to write much right now put. Anything you want to learn about me is in my profile.

  13 more days until my vacation  not like I'll be going anywhere but It'll be nice to have the two weeks off. I'm downloading the beta for the new Warhammer 40k game  should be interesting  last time I beta tested a game it was Everquest for the PS2  I didn't like it  it was my first experience with a MMORPG and it really do anything for me. I do enjoy FFXI  but I think it's in part due to the fact it's based on a series I already know and enjoy. I remember a few years ago Bandai said the they were going to release a Gundam MMO  when I heard that I quickly and promptly  urlLink pissed  myself. Honestly the only thing I would have enjoyed more would've been a Macross MMO  unfortunately Bandai canned it  should have know it was too good to be true. Well talk to ya later. ,0
  If you live in Canada you've probably heard that a Wal-Mart in Quebec has unionized  I won't get into the details or anything  I'll just say that while I have no real desire to have my store unionized I am hoping that this will scare the hirer ups and maybe start paying their employees a decent salary  I mean it's pretty sad when your full timers don't make enough to live on their own. ,0
  Well I'm back  SP2 for windows decided that it didn't like the fact that my PC was functional and swiftly took steps to correct the matter. Long story short  I stumped myself and Microsoft tech support  I couldn't even get past the loading screen  and safe mode wouldn't load. So I had to take it into the shop to get the HDD wiped. I also passed my aptitude and physical test for the Canadian Armed Forces  I'm glad it's over  the physical wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I'm on vacation for the next two weeks  nice to have sometime off. ,0
  Almost everyone I know online is saying BLOG. What is it I ask and after reading a few from those I know  I learned that its an open journal; that almost everyone online can read. But why  isnt a journal supposed to be private? I asked. Some say that they want their life to be an open book and others may say well I dont really post everything that happened. Still  I am a bit off with this.  So in order to know more of this  I decided to make my own so I may experience and learn about this thing called blog. This will be something from what I do and I dont know what will happen. Only time can tell. ,0
  Still  I cant put myself to really use this blog as a personal public viewed journal. I believe that a journal and its content should be private. I think a person who blogs is either a boastful person or a person who is just lazy to use a pen or  a person whos penmanship is so bad that even he/she could not recognize his/her writing. In any case  each person has his/her own opinion about the matter and I should respect that even if I dont like it. ,0
  As I journey through this world of Blogging  I cant help notice these scripts called quizzes. When I was teaching  one of the activities that most students hate is quizzes. But now  as I browse the blogs of some of my students  a large number of them post quizzes on their sites. I inquired as to why they like these quizzes and most of them replied that these quizzes is sort of personal and delivers a result that they find amusing.  As I delved into this  I cant help but ask myself  can I apply this approach to my students in school? If possible  how?  Here's a samples of what quizzes are available to be used in ones blog:        Your love is... by  urlLink  ChibiMarronchan        Your name is...           Your kiss is...    mysterious      Your hugs are...    to die for      Your eyes...    burn into my heart      Your touch is...    irresistable      Your smell is...    refreshing      Your smile is...    hypnotising      Your love is...    one of a kind               urlLink  Quiz created with MemeGen  ! ,0
  Its fun to the max  this whole writing on the computer thing. This way I don't have to freak out about my messy handwriting! Seeing as this is my first post  I am not going to take the time to voice opinions  share thoughts  examine beliefs  view ideas  yeah  you get the picture? The reason for that is because I am  well  first of all tired and second  I am...well  tired! There you go...I am just about having fun in the Lord and not having this whole pious  reverent aura about me  all the time. My God is one of crazy...in a sense. Hey now! Not crazy like...Terminator/Governor crazy  but a sense of him being just crazy for us and us being wild for him!    Shoot  I just voiced an opinion... ,0
"  I cant figure out why some people only give out their opinions only to destroy someone else. What is wrong with people today? I'm sick and tired of hearing views and beliefs on politics  religion  and other stuff. I'm sick of seeing the way people behave when it comes to opposing views. Why can't we just...I don't know...Sit and enjoy the fresh air on a spring day? Sounds corny I know  but isn't that better than bashing a man for what he thinks is right or wrong. What did Jesus do? He ate with people that were wrong and people who reveled in their own beliefs.  He loved them  he didn't care! I'm so sick of us so called Christians seeking out only people who disagree with us only to prove that we are right! What worth is that? Will the glory of the coming Lord be enough for them and us? I guess not because all we care about is making sure that we are right and that they are wrong. Why can't we enjoy life  loving people  enjoying that we are different and loving them to Christ  not proving it to them. Life is so short. How can we make it count if we don't live by example and live with him? When I go out in the world I will try hard not to condemn people but love them  and in the meantime...Sit and enjoy the day  instead of sinking in my own so-called ""righteousness"". God did not create man to argue...But to love  and prosper with him. And...By the way...If you are going to talk with people who don't agree with you  remember this  ""the greatest single cause of atheism in the world today...Is Christians...Who acknowledge him with their lips and walk out the door and lead on with their lifestyle. That is what I'm believing the world simply finds unbelievable."" ",0
  And so begins the life of my blog  a true understanding of what it is to be bloggish. Okay  so maybe I made that word up. I thought I would begin my disadvantageous interest in blogging for the first time. I have read many and participated in none. Creating this posting off of pure allurement of the idea has been quite interesting and (hopefully) stays that way. Today I create  and juxtapose the ideas of life and wonderment of a being  which whom  has a slightly higher interest in being more than most. With this  I bid you farewell until next time  for now I have work to do. ,0
"  Today I write on were I live  but I think I shall start with were I am from. I give you this information so that when you read my future commentaries  you will understand why I think the things I do.     I grew up in the metropolitan city of Tulsa  Oklahoma  born in 1979 and lived there until I was 18 years old. My school career consisted of living and learning with the same group of kids from Elementary~High School (give or take a few). I made many friends and lived within a social standard that rated second to none. I had everything I wanted  popularity and a social stance that should make Barbie jealous. There I was happy. After graduation I decided to move to Atlanta  Georgia (good old Hotlanta). There I lived for 2 years among my father's side of the family within a few miles of where I stayed. Atlanta was beautiful and had a lot to offer to someone seeking a professional business career  but it had it's down side too. I soon found that the night life was too enticing to ignore  and I knew I would break myself long before any good could come of the situation. With that  I moved to Michigan. As a child I would come up every summer to a small lake located between a small city and an even smaller township. I had always thought (then) that I would move to the lake and have a life of lake living and contentment upon knowing people with a higher stature and career driven lifestyles.           Now  after all that back ground I can finally tell you my stories of what I would like to call  ""As the village turns."" ",0
  I love to see the ocean's beauty   And the moon that shines above   Alone in the sand looking at the stars   Wishing someday I would find true love   Would it be nice to see the morning   With the one you love the most   Would it be nice to say goodnight   To the one you hold so close to your heart......to your heart    The wind that blows the dove   is the wind that blows my love   Hope it'll find its way to you wherever you are    I love to sit in fields of green   Looking deeply through the sky   Watching birds as they fly by   Hoping someday fate will bring me true love   Would it be nice to hold someone   So dear  near your heart   Would it be nice to hear those words   I love you from the one that you love...... that you love    The wind that blows the dove   is the wind that blows my love   Hope it'll find its way to you wherever you are    I'd love to see myself one day   In the arms of someone   Who will share her life with me   Selflessly   Someday   You will find your way to me    The wind that blows the dove   is the wind that blows my love   Hope it'll find its way to you wherever you are ,0
  Baby I still love you but that dont mean much   Despite the ways Ive loved you you just cant be touched   I need to know  why you dont love me back   I need you so...    Why do I keep hoping that someday youll change   When matters of the heart just cant be arranged   I need to let go  I know youll never love me back   I need it to be so but youll never give me that    I dont want to feel it anymore   I dont want to find myself outside your door   I dont want to give my heart away   Not for free  not for one more day   So make it go away   Just make it go away    Every time I see you I just catch my breath   It hurts to know that I dont have that same effect   I need you to feel  the way you make me feel   I need it to be real but it never will    I dont want to feel it anymore   I dont want to find myself outside your door   I dont want to give my heart away   Not for free when you dont love me   So make it go away    So make it go  go away   I dont want to feel it anymore   So make it go  go away   So make it go away    Baby I still love you but that dont mean much... ,0
  Well  here I am. I decided to start a blog. Now  I am not entirely sure why I decided this for a number of reasons. 1. I am rubbish at writing journals/diaries/most things  so this is not going to be very good 2. I dont really know anyone on this thing so no one is actually going to read it  but I guess it might be therapeutic...or something 3. I live a relatively boring life  so there is not going to be that much to write in here.  So apart from all them  this seemed like a good idea at the time!  A few days ago I came back from a holiday in America. America is awesome. If you ever get a chance to go  you should. And if youve already been then... go again! I had a simply marvellous time! Visited both New York and Orlando... had to go to Disneyland. new York is like no where else  I stupidly thought London was a big  busy  over-crowded city  but it is nothing next New York City. I am not sure if I would want to return  as i have now done the whole statue of liberty  show on Broadway  baseball game thing... but saying that I do think I would like to go back with a bunch of mates and just go crazy! Florida was... well... hot. And heat does not like me much. Therefore I tried to avoid it by standing under lots of fans. Despite this  I still managed to get heat rash and a severe case of sun burn. I think the sun does this to me on purpose. I also discovered that universal studios is better than Disney land... I couldnt tell you if the rides at Disney land are better than those at universal studios  mainly due to the fact that I couldnt get on half of the rides at Disney due to the immense amount of queuing it would have taken. Queuing that I can not be arsed to do.  Hmm... this is the end of my first entry. I do not want to end it here as I do not think i have really told people much  but my brain works in mysterious ways... possibly through the use of 3.5 small monkeys and lots of sticky tape... but however it works  it does not want to think of any more to write right now. ,0
  This post is simply to view and then edit the appearance of this particular journaling site.  Mind the changes. ,0
  And I can't really talk about it  yet. Not until I'm comfortable with this website. I've been everywhere  written so many different things  and I always feel censured  restricted. I'll explain  in due time. ,0
  So there's this life I'm living  and only some know about parts of it  and I can't really write yet about any of it. Every time I find somewhere I think I'm comfortable writing  someone steps in and takes that feeling away  swiftly and murderously. I like to write  it's obvious  I've been doing it for years  but I like to write what I want  about whatever I want  and it's hard to do so while striving for anynomity. I hate having to hide behind a mask of unrecognizable features  just to tell the story of my life. The true story of my life  no frills  no strings attached  the real deal. But there some who who'd most definitely not approve  and though I can't blame her for getting upset at the things I do and think about  I can't help it  it's just how I am. It's the life I live  and I'm still not being very specific. Do you know  that if she were to read this  she'd hound me until the year's end asking what I'm talking about  what things in my life I do but can't write about  what would upset her  blah blah  and we all know how that goes  surely. So instead  I find another spot  and take my time trying to find comfort in that spot  with intent to eventually just write everything. I tire of taking out a pen and notebook  jotting everything down  while knowing I'm the only one who gets to read it. I'm a bit conceited  self-centered maybe  when I say I want others to hear my story  too. That's what these sites are all about  though  writing as a sort of entertainment towards others. That's just what we all like to do.  So with that all said  give me a few more entries where no one specifically is asking me anything  and I'll start writing about the real thing. Until then  please bare with my rambling. ,0
  Super Smash Bros. Melee is my most favorite game in the world. It is a four-player fighting game that has super simple moves compared to other fighting games. However  don't think that it is an easy game to beat and no fun to play. You still must master moves for a character just like you would for any other fighting game. You have to know when to sidestep dodge  jump  and attack your opponent. You have to know when to roll behind and when to retreat. Only true master can beat Giga Bowser and the Master and Crazy hand!  Not only do you have to beat Classic  Adventure  and All-Star mode  you also have to beat all the event matches and get all 290 trophies! This is a must have for any Gamecube owner  and that means YOU! Buy it now! I am saying this out of my own love towards the game  and I am not a walking advertiser :)  Recently  there was a Melee Tournament in our area  and out of two and a half pages worth of people  guess who came out first...ME! I got hoards of stuff! I love being the best at Melee! Surprisingly  they never got me down to one life! It consisted of many three life stock battles. I brought my memory card and they let me use it because they had NO characters. I have 100 percent beaten that game.  Also  I have kept a profile name. It has over 1000 wins and around fifty losses. No  I play my brothers and Level 9 CPUs. I stopped the playing timer at 9 999:59! That's around 163 hours  and I know that I played more than that! I am a freak of this game and have emailed Nintendo multiple times on when the next Super Smash will come  but they said there has been none announced. If you know PLEASE TELL ME. I hope the DS will have the game. Just think... PORTABLE SUPER SMASH!!!  If you think you can beat me in Melee  I think I can beat you. You may not be easy  but I'm trying to become the best in the world! Come talk to me If YOU LOVE SUPER SMASH BROS. MELEE!!!!  I also have the original Super Smash Bros.  but I think it's nothing compared to Melee. All you have to do in that game is throw. It's fake  but I still like it. You can talk to me about that too.  Dr. Mario is cheap! ,0
"  Ok  I'm a little nervous as this is my first blog post ever! Please bear with me!

"  Hopefully I don't become obsessed about entering info daily here...truth be told  there is nothing on TV. Saw an interesting personal license plate ""No Klu""...someone obviously not familiar with american culture. Well thats kind of on par with some restaurants in my neighborhood ""The Edibles"" and ""Veg Table"" (more wacky bad english interpretations to come). Ok  now I'm on a roll! Lets get into some little things that piss me off. In L.A. someone decided to memorialize freeways to dead cops and people of inerest. Now  I'm not insensitive to a cop being killed on the job  but do we really have to name a freeway after them? They chose there job  and knew the risk...I'm sorry. I'm sure I will not be allowed to get my street re-named after my dead cat! And the ""Rosa Parks Freeway""? Did I miss her bus ride on the 10 freeway when I was growing up? Now what WOULD be cool...commercial freeways. Taking the Tide freeway east to the Viagra interchange north to connect to the Budweiser freeway east...ahh  home at last. ",0
  Its getting real nasty out there. This has to be the worst election year in the history of the U.S.. I'm not going to reiterate all the stupid things said on both sides  nor am I going to repeat the lies from both parties. Let me just say  I don't want another reckless 4 years with Bush. On the other hand  I don't want 4 years with Kerry. But these are my choices. What I believe WILL happen after one of these bafones gets elected. The people will rise up  get it together  and find a true leader for our country...out of the shit grows daffodiles! Hang on  its only going to smell worse during the next four years. ,0
"  As you may or may not have seen in the Description of the site  This is mainly a site speaking of a 16 year-old(me) who's recently switched to Mac from 13 years of using a PC.  My name is David and I'm into anime  computers  and DDR(Dance Dance Revolution).  I will speak of these things often.  My life is typically very dull  so if it sounds like I'm making something up  I probably am  you can ask me  I don't mind.  As I currently have no readers  I don't have to bother with updating or anything but i'm going to try and have a tad bit of a schedule.... so I say now.... Anyways  I hope everyone enjoys my life because I'm willing to sell it for a lot of money....heheheh... ahh... if only I was kidding.  David  PS. I'm writing this on my G4 iBook 1GHz/12.1"" ",0
  Well  I know its been a little while since I last spoke  but Im extrodinarily lazy  so its ok...  All five of you are probably wondering who it was that responded to my last post.  That would be my girlfriend *hears in the background awww...*.  Anyways  from the time I last posted  not much has happened.  On Wednesday  I got pulled over by a cop on my Vino Scooter(which in VA doesnt require a license)  he pulled me over and asked for my ID  which I readily supplied; he looke it over and said he had no problem with me.  He then proceded to say that hes had complaints about mopeds in the area(a motoscooter is classified as a moped here) and he also wanted to warn me about a new law passed a few days ago requiring all moped drivers to carry an ID with Name  Address  and Birthdate.  I said ok and sped off on my merry way.  I wouldnt have had so much trouble with him if he hadnt blared his siren at me.  Anyways  on Saturday  I went to Tysons Corner Mall(The local really expensive mall) for about half a day.  I went up and was going to go to a few classes at the Apple Store.  I attended half of one and the others never happened.  No real big deal for me  but I really wanted to attend those  and now I will never have the chance *sniff*.  Ah well  such is life.  Anyways  Tuesday is Medallios Birthday  if anyone in the area knows her and reads this blog  wish her a happy birthday.  Goodnight and may Eris stay the Heck away from you   David ,0
"  Cameron woke up at 4:00 a.m. from a strange noise coming from the kitchen. She thought it must have been Mrs. Chives from upstairs doing something. Cameron is a cautious girl  so she got up to check it out  just in case. She grabbed her pepper spray from the drawer of her bedside table and slowly walked towards the kitchen door. She pushed the door half way open  quietly  and stuck her head inside. She looked around the kitchen  but didn't see anything. Being annoyed by the whole ordeal  she dragged herself back to bed. She almost fell asleep again  untill she heard someone humming at the end of the hallway  with a woman's voice. Cameron is also a very down-to-earth girl  so she tried to find a reasonable explenation for it... it's like a reflex. ""Maybe someone is lost or something..."" she said to herself in a trembling voice. The humming sound kept getting louder and more intence  and the room got a bit cold. Her bedroom door was half open  and the only thing that lit up the room a bit was the moonlight  shining through the window. She kept staring at the hallway and breathing heavily  listening to the humming sound. She thought of asking who it is  but she wasn't that bold. Out of the darkness from the hallway  she could see two bright red eyes... she just sat up on her bed and had her eyes wide open. She didn't know what to do  so she panicked. She closed her eyes tight and tried to convince herself that it was just a dream. As soon as she opened them  she saw a shadowy figure standing at the foot of her bed  with the bright red eyes. It whispered something to her  but she couldn't understand it  mostly because she was terrified and extremely anxious. It reached over to Cameron's face  and she could see it's hand in the moonlight  it was as white as snow. Before she could do anything  her window opened and someone jumped inside! The figure with the red eyes turned  facing the other person. It started hissing  and it vanished in thin air. Cameron couldn't believe her eyes!      Who is that someone who saved her?   Did you like my story so far??? If you want to find out who that person is and what that creature was doing there  read my next post!!! ;) ",0
  Well  it's time for another one of these thingies! I'll write more about everything when I can fully function. Toodle Loo! ,0
  Yes  well here is the continuance (I know I spelt that wrong. Let me be!) of this morning's blog. Hmm....where to start though. I have an idea! Let's start from the beginning of all this crap. ,0
  Sorry I haven't been on here in a couple of days. School started  so there ya' go. Anywho! There are some things that we just need to catch up on. Like....school started today! This could have not been a worse day ever! I mean  it's awesome that I have every class with Anthony Roland. He is cool and all  but he was picking on me all day.....Expecally in Stiles' class. And then Kyle and Robert had to join him. I mean  sure. One person can only take so much  but this was past the bar line. And then  what pissed me off the most  was that when I was drinking the water out of the bottle  Robert just had to tip the bottle up  so it got all over me! Yeah  I was pissed!!! I still am! I mean  how come he did this?! I don't know...I'm all puzzled by this all. ,0
"  Well  today was another eventful day of school...if that's what you want to call it. Today was a ""B"" day  so I had Adv. English; Band; Alg. II; and Adv. Biology. I really don't like these days.

  Well... I am unsure how to start this new blogging stuff...guess I will just reflect a little and see how it goes.  Have you ever been stuck in a matrix? I have! To me it was like being in a padded  suspended time warp during the early part of  my adult life. A time that lasted over 12 years. That shouldnt happen to anyone...and shouldnt have happen to me. But it did. I was 23   a new single mom...no friends...no job...and not much family to speak of. I had to make money and take care of my son... I couldnt afford to live on my own so me and my child stayed with my parents... I went back to school and learned a vocation. Then... tried for years and years to make a difference...be somebody and amount to something for my sons sake...the matrix I was in got thicker and harder to escape from...I couldnt do enough for anyone. My parents  my employer  so called friends  relatives.... it was like total non-acceptance...I felt laughed at and demeaned.  (Like a RedHeaded Step Child.)  I had a vision of the way I wanted my life and it wasnt happening. Feeling like every move I made no matter how positive only enabled those around me to throw dirt on my emotions and aspirations and even me. They would throw dirt on me! Spreading slanderous rumor making ugly innuendo... I would try and try to ignore and endure.  Oh!Gaud; How did I get there?  So much time had gone by in this continuum...my ideas were lost. Buried in the gook and gum of this matrix intra-cellular structure...  I got really  mad  one day and more or less threw my hands up in despare...then... feeling terribly terribly  angry ... I suddenly broke free from the matrix by desiding right then and there ...That I was going to make a move. A move that would  change  my life and those that went with me for the better.  The  anger  did it...I was fed up...I had gotten to the point where I hated everyone around me...I had to get out or die trying...  It took alot out of me. It was a draining yet somehow refreshing experience.... In a way I was reborn...a new beginning... a time to be  me  and a very liberating change...  I had escaped.... It was my Independance Day... ,0
  Hey there....Sherrie here. Fancy meeting you. Glad you could stop in!      Let me introduce myself.... My name is Sherrie  I am 27 years old  I live in Kentucky  work for a short-line  railroad company  married to a wonderful husband (Lauren)  have no children (yet) and I love to crochet!      My husband also works for a railroad related industry that manufactures railroad crossties. He enjoys his job as much as I do  which is a lot! We do not have any children  but are in the process of becoming foster and adoptive parents for this state and are anxiously awaiting the approval letter and arrival of our first child. I can imagine that my crocheting time will decrease even more when this happens! LOL      Now  enough about me  and on to the topic at hand - crochet!      I have alot of different projects started  from plastic canvas  to thread and yarn crochet. My most favored project is the 63 squares combine to make an afghan. I have not been working on this project all that long  but I have finished the first 5 squares  and this  I am happy about! I am on the 6th one now  and it isn't as fun. It is wanting to roll up like a paper towel tube and I have to fight with it to make it do what I want it to do! LOL      I will try to post some pictures of my squares and this project as soon as I can. I will close for now  and crochet some more....until next time - happy crocheting to you! ,0
  Well  last night it stormed something fierce. Thunder  lightning and tons of rain. It sure made a nice evening to crochet. I finished with the 6th square now  and have started the one with the cluster braid. It is not hard at all  and seems to be going fairly quickly. I like this part. I will try to finish this one today. I have a terrible headache  so I don't know how much I will get to do.  I am working on my squares in the order  going down the left  in strips. Once I have 9 squares done  in the first row  I will attach them together and begin to really see some progress. It only has 7 strips  so once you get one done  it will go smoothly from then on out.  Well  until next time - happy crocheting from my hook to yours! ,0
"  Oh yes  it's my first blog post--I had a diary  but this thing looks oh-so-much cooler...Today was actually a lot better than I expected it to be. School was short  and non-boring. I actually didn't get an buttload of work the first day so I'm a happy kid as of right now...I probably should be in bed  but yeah I'm dumb and I'm doing this instead *woo hoo* I actually wasn't going to make one  but I wanted to post a comment on Will's thingy and it wouldnt let me without an account haha so oh well.  Yeah  I'd have to say the most interesting thing about today happened at the pool after school...I went up the mountain w/ Will to get some *more* sun so we can be super hot for our senior pics on Friday  and as we were gettin ready to leave  he got on top of my chair and gave me a kiss--well  I sat up and * BAM * my top falls off lol oh yes...good times...Yeah  it wasnt TOO funny at the time  but it kicks the shit outta me now lol That'll definitely be a good story to tell the kiddies...""Look mom  it's a girl without her top on!"" ...great... haha  Well  I've still got some stuff to finish up for tomorrow--more tanning up the mountain...except this time with a broken swimsuit lol hmm  maybe it's time to get another one? Oh well  I guess I'll just go topless :)~ JUST KIDDING...geez  dont get too excited.  Ok well I'm really goin this time--leave me lots of happy comments for my blog and make me feel special!!! ",0
"  Wow  yep I havent written in here in like two weeks atleast  but I'm not gonna try to put a shitload of stuff in here. I got my senior pictures back yesterday  and they're actually pretty good. Or atleast like 4 of em are... I'm hoping that I'll still be able to get professional ones  even though I don't really need them haha it's just fun to have your picture taken man.  I've still got to read this god-awful book for English ...Heart of Darkness... one kid put it very nicely:     ""This is one of the most poorly and confusingly done novels ever written. With such an interesting plot  I was amazed at how utterly boring and clouded the novel became  the only reason this novel is still in print is because english teachers get hard-ons through mental masturbation trying to analyze this overly ambiguous work.""

"  So  I swear I meet someone everyday that is so profound  I dont think that I ever have the thoughts to equate to their greatness. I met this guy once who changed my life in 2 days of subbing for one of my classes. A free-lance actor  better yet  a free-lance thinker. I can see why people say that when you meet the right person you could run away with them and nothing would ever matter.  In the book Catch 22  they talk about running away. And they debate  that running away is bad  because your problems will eventually come back to haunt you  and the conclusion was that he wasnt running away  he was running to his problems  rather making his life more interesting with every second that he spends.  Sometimes  with all of my set ""life-plans"" I want to not forget  that I cant live in--what will happen in the future  but rather in this moment. I never want to be the girl who is uncontent with this moment  because I cant wait for the next moment.  Could that free-lance thinker help me run away. All i know is that  when I want a serious relationship and even think about marriage  I want to meet someone exactly like him. Who I can ""run away"" with  to solve my problems head on  and live in this moment. ",0
"  Hey  I feel like its been awhile  when in all relativety  my mind is always thinking and it feels like awhile  because things come and go in my head  and by the time  i get to this very ""subject"" of this post  I have been through many other subjects as well.  First off    to get it off my mind  I just saw the movie ""little black book"" and ending said something like  life happens most  when you are planning for something that is approaching. So stop planning and live your life now. That totally goes against my life  because I have always been the planner  because then I think that I get what I want. But what if I didnt plan  and got what I needed the most  and secretly wanted the most too. But then if you dont plan at all  you could be a loser who doesnt do anything. Conflicting thoughts. I have always told myself not to plan so much  its just that it comes so naturally to me  to plan for college  plan why someone likes me  plan how i mangage my friends  money...everything. Maybe I will start by unplanning some of those things..and letting them come to me. One small thing at a time. I suppose.   we;ll talk soon. Caitlyn ",0

"  so first and foremost i have to give credit to nichole who brought me up to 2004 and introduced me to this whole blog thing. i have a feeling i am going to become an addict.   so i signed up for this and they asked me to fill out a profile and then proceeded to cut and paste whatever they wanted out of it. example  i wrote a whole paragraph about how i was so happy that they made the question ""name your favorite books"" because usually it just asks for one but then proceeds to ask for your favorite TV showS. i capitalize the S because they want it to be plural. as if you should be watching more TV and reading less. i guess it's easier and most people filling out these surveys are not interested in writing for hours about their favorite reads  but instead about what happened last night in nick and jessica. actually i could tell you because secretly kate and i watch it and then wonder what it would be like if MTV came and filmed us....i'll leaving wanting more only because my point of this is i am being censored in the wrong way. you see i promote reading and educating yourself  you know seeking the truth  finding your own path and they cut that shit out. what the f**k? oh i just realized this is correct  oh my bad this is the new interpretation of the first ammendment. sorry thanks for the correction. i forgot we are all suppose to be getting our news from FOX and nevermind the independent thinking it wears on the brain  let someone else do it for you. okay nevermind  just disregard what i just wrote and recommence status quo.  so already i love this blog thing except i don't think anyone is going to read it. but it's okay i already feel better  it's like free therapy...i mean someone may read it and laugh or think oh this poor girl  how pathetic...but whatever i can write about all my shit and if kate wants to catch up on what i am thinking (because she always says  ""i don't know what you are thinking"") she can log on and read instead of strong arming me into watching nick and jessica. ",0
  so it has been decided....i am going to start my book on this. i am going to post my stories  all of them. if the response is overwhelming i am going to put it all together in the appropriate format and get it published. i have a story to tell  actually many short stories to tell  and i think that people will want to read. so enjoy. ,0
  Okay  folks. Raise your hands if you think it'd take two days to clean a one bedroom apartment from top to bottom. No hands? Well  join the club. Unfortunately  that's how long it took me to get this lovely place I call home clean. But now I look around  and it's great  cleaner than it's ever been. So all that hard work paid off in the end.  The weather outside is gorgeous  and I'm listening to music on my computer as I type this. Why did I just tell you that? Well  that's what it's like here right now. I'm also waiting for Kristen to get home  so we can go out and have fun. So drop me a line sometime  any of y'all who might read this. Lookin' forward to hearin' from you soon. ,0
  Okie dokie  folks...my sister showed me her web log  I thought it looked cool  so I decided to start one.  I don't know how much I'll write on here; I tend to start something for a week or two  then activity falls off.  We'll see how long I can keep this one going.    I'm sure you want to know a little about me.  I currently live in a nice little suburb of Chicago called Schaumburg.  I moved up here a little over two years ago to go to law school at DePaul University  and to be slightly closer (by about 1200 miles) to the love of my life  Kristen.  I have a year left of law school (woohoo!)  and then it's off to the real world.  I have a passion for three things in life: Kristen  flying  and good food.  Near-passions include country music (yee-haw)  four wheel drive  good movies  and probably a bunch of other stuff that just doesn't seem to come to mind at the moment.  As I write in this  though  y'all ought to be able to figure out what I'm into and what I'm not.  Well  that's about enough for now.  Time to get cleaning (this place looks like a tornado had a wild party and all his friends were invited).  So if any of y'all have any ideas for postings  let me know.  Signing off for now. ,0
"  Well this will be my first entry. Here goes.... I'm 27 and I feel like I'm going on 80. I have a huge cat and an amazing boyfriend and we all live happily together. The only imperfect thing about my Prince Charming is  He has not asked ""the"" question yet. Officially we have lived together for 1 year and including that time we have been together 1 year and 9 months. I really want to be married to him. More than anything ever. We have never fought and he doesn't annoy me. Even when he doesn't load the dishwasher correctly. I want to have a baby or two and live happily ever after. I'm not really that naive  but that is what I want. Before this one I was in a relationship that  although I'm glad it ended  was supposed to be a marriage. And when My current boyfriend (lets call him ""JB"") JB and I decided to move in together he was aware of my desire for marriage and told me he wouldn't move in if that's not where he thought we were headed. I made a deal with myself that if he did ask within a year then he is OUT. Well  I know it's hard to believe but he really is practically perfect. When I hear friends discuss the stupid  thoughtless  even rude crap their boyfriends do it just makes JB's halo shine brighter. It takes time right? There is no time limit on love....Right??? No  really  I want someone to tell me to relax. It's hard to decide whether or not to stick around and wait for a proposal or find someone who is less who I want and just get married so I can start a family. I feel like I have to choose between a GREAT guy or having kids (the bio-clock is a tickn' and I ain't gettin' younger). ",0
"  Ahhh  So after a talk with a friend and a weekend in the country I'm much calmer. Saturday was absolutely wonderful. JB and I went to a farmer's market  went swimming then fell asleep on the grass in the shade. The relaxation was much needed and I feel soo great. Oh  we went shopping on Friday and I spent way too much money. I got some supper cute heels though. I've always been into girlie things. I love pink but this season is making it sooo much easier to be into pink. I love it. I bought little pink heels with wonderful tiny black bows on the side. I also bought a bunch of ""work"" clothes. I'm soo happy! ",0

"  yes i can now say i have met a gentleman. don't know if it's the electrical problems in his car or he just opens the door like a gentleman SHOULD do for a lady. i met  him on july 10th  2 days after my 23rd birthday. so it would be a month of knowing each other. he came at a perfect time  ariam had left san diego to go back home to CH...and so i was left doing nothing for my so called ""special day"".   the homeboy jerry wanting to see mobb deep and partially pittying me for being bummed out accompanied me to the show. after the mobb deep performance  i didn't really have anyone to dance w/ besides jerry. a part of me was saying...""hey girl! you are now 23! live it up! don't be so insecure! go up to somebody!""   i was talking to hasani when i saw him. the shy and insecure me would've never smiled back. but as i continued chit chatting w/ my friend  at the corner of my eye i could see him stealing glances at me. so i made my way to this fella  tapped his arm and asked him to dance. i hung on to his arm and he led us to the dancefloor. ahhh the reggae room. perfect. we danced  and a few minutes later i excused myself remembering that jerry was by his lonesome in the hip hop room. ""what a bad friend "" i thought.   later on the night about an hour or so after  i ran into this fella again. i notioned for another dance. he was kind enough and said yes. so we danced and had small talk. then he said  ""i don't mean to be rude  but can i have your #?"" so that's how it all started.

  i have never experienced a death in my immediate family  and so that is what i fear most. my grandma's ill...yes  she was diagnosed w/ cancer yesterday. i feel so lifeless. already i have given up  lost hope  and her battle hasn't even begun. so as i laid in bed last night i prayed for my grandma's well being. i tried to convince myself that i wasn't praying for selfish reasons  but really i was. i needed her  to be there for me...to watch me walk down the aisle  to hold my first born and see them grow up. i've been walking through clouds since i found out. not a care for the world  not a care for myself... ,0
  Well I don't know what exactly the purpose of this is....but I thought it could be a good way to meet new friends....and express my ideas....don't have nothing expecific to say just dealing with been single and dealing with dating....that is always a headache! new people new problems...the uncomfortable beginning of having to explain to someone your life in one date! and as time pass  finding out all the lies!! men are such liars! but I guess we are too! oh well  I love men and I can't live with out them!! ,0
  God!! If I could go back in time I would go to a sperm bank instead of having to deal with a dumb$$ baby daddy! well at one point he was my husband but now he has the title of baby daddy if I could call him that! Some men are so worthless that they make some women turn lesbians! I have tried in every way to deal with him and nothing! I tried been nice  getting angry and basically not giving a f***! and nothing! I get no emotion from him but some how everything is my fault! and I guess he is right  cause its my fault I got involved with him sorry a$$! The only thing that upsets me now is that my son is growning up with out a dad! Financially we don't need him cause I have a good job  but a child always need his two parents and when one is out  well there is only soo much the other parent can do. And sad to say that I know I'm not the only women dealing with a sorry baby daddy and the thing is that he isn't hurting me but he is hurting someone he created and has his same blood  his SON!! Maybe us as women are more connected with our emotions and I couldn't picture not seeing my son for months and men just go on with their life without a care about it! Clubbing and living the single life when we have to stay home and be responsible mothers and take care of our kids with double responsibilities cause while they are out creating more babies! All I know is that I'm doing the best I can and my son will know that I gave him everything he needed...and he will also know that his dad choose not to participate in his life....and as for his dad  well---- PAYBACK IS A B****!!!! ONE DAY HE WILL GET HIS! ,0
  I love that word. Ponderings. If you break it up you get pond  like lake  eh  like oh  ring like disaster. Because wedding rings do tend to end up in disaster. So pondering is like dipping into a lake of disaster. Mmmm. Maybe if I shut my eyes I'll be able to feel the waves washing over me  hear the delicate ripples as leaves fall into my pond and breathe in the air of immortality. If the Philosophers Stone is a soluble tablet  my lake of disaster is the solution for it. Like in chemistry. I dreamt the other night that I was in a cold  dark lake and that I was below  watching the world through a rippled mirror. I saw myself peering down and a white hand slooshing the water and slooshing my view. When it was finally clear again  all there was was a star that lit up the lake. And in the middle of the star  there was me  spread out in a crucifix shape with my eyes blazing and my hair fanning out like it does underwater. I reached out to feel the wetness on my hair  but I felt only heat as the star plunged into the icy water and I melted into oblivion. I love random dreams. ,0
  Hi  I'm Tash and this is my random blog which I created for two reasons. One is because I was bored  two because I wanted a gmail account and three because I decided the world needed to hear the random Ponderings of a Nutcase. So thats me. The nutcase. I live in New Zealand in a house with a cat and a dog. And I like to be random. And my pet peeves are French keyboards  the sounds MSN makes and jingle singers. I mean who really puts on their CV  'Ah yes  that's me. I sang in the Felix Catfood jingle.' ??? Also  I don't like Bush. At all. And I don't like Micheal Jackson because he has a dead nose and sings like a sick hippo. There are lots of things I do like though. I like melted mozerella  the number 666 - just a random thought but if there is an apocolypse  wouldn't it happen on 06/06/06? Just a random vibe - and I like redheads. I love shopping. Shoe shopping. But I hate French keyboards and porridge. I think that is enough randomness for now. More later. Tash P.S. If anyone has a gmail account they don't want well... lets just say I know a taker... ,0
  I went to the little lockin at Magic Springs last night and we were there from 10 at night till 4 in the morning. It was not worth the money. That's messed up that it cost $17 when I bought a pass. That's why I bought a pass  so I didn't have to pay to get in. I'm really tired today. I'm kind of disapointed that Jaclyn was out of town this weekend. We were supposed to go bowling tonight but she had to go to El Dorado. I would have rather gone bowling than to Magic Springs. I think this chick at the church was stalking me. I was walking alone  thinking about stuff  and she saw me and left her friends to walk with me. I had not even met her before tonight but  it turns out she was one of my ex girlfriends best friends sister. How ironic? Oh well  she was pretty cool. Then when we got back to the church we watched t.v. Well  most everybody slept. Jenna tried but I kept her awake  he he he. Jenna and I finally got to talk  I'm glad I got that stuff off my chest. Thanks Jenna. Jaclyn would be proud of me today  I slept from 6:30 this morning to 3:00 this afternoon. I'm still really tired though so I think all I need to say has been said. L8r. ,0
"  I'm getting so frustrated with my dad. He's making me so mad. I sat up last night till about 1:00 because I was so mad. Well  our house is for sale. I guess they still want to think that I'm moving too. My parents are trying to make me feel bad for breaking the ""family"" up. Family my a$$. Yesterday I went to my moms house and played some music. There were so many people there. we had about 5 or 6 guitar players  3 or 4 bass players  and 2 or 3 drummers. We think we may have a band formed though. Me  a guy named Matt who plays guitar  his brother who will play either bass or guitar  and Dean who will play whichever intrument Matt's brother doesn't play. Dean is awesome. He went to Juliard for four years playing bass but if you give him a flute  he would probly know how to play it. It's early and I need to go to band practice soon so I better stop writting. ",0

"  So today is my moms  49th birthday. We went out for dinner to Timbers  it was Really good!! Its hard to believe its already her birthday. It seems like this summer is going by so fast. Sometimes  well a lot of the time  it scares me how fast time goes. I guess you just have to live every minute to the fullest...which is hard sometimes. Oh well  thats life.  I'm not in the mood to dwell on serious topics like this right now..so i'll be moving on to something a bit happier.  I'm going to a cottage tomorrow with a whole bunch of my friends. Its in Grand Bend  right on the main strip. I hope its fun. It will be...we always have fun together. I dunno though  for some reason im not really looking forward to it. Maybe its because I just started to like this guy Matt  and I dont want to leave and not be able to talk to him. I know its only for a few days  but im in that ""just srarting to like someone"" phase  and i like talking to him as much as possible. Oh well  the week will go by really fast  and Ill be back here  and able to talk to him as much as i want. Well  its been a pretty boring day...not much to talk about.  So  i think ill end this one here. Michele... ",0
  I haven't felt well for a few days and I am beginning to feel better.. I don't know why  but I haven't been sick for a long time. - Weird.. but I felt sick this week.. but never threw up or anything.. just felt like shit!      School is comming very fast and I hate it. There was barely any summer whatsoever.. it was like never hott. And along with school comes soccer season.. which means lots of running and exercise.. I better get practicing.. ugh. I also was supposed to read this summer  this was supposed to happen while i was tanning - I tanned twice.  Pages for reading contract - 0     It sucks but its the truth..  I'm going to Hampton Beach with the fam. soon - what fun.. - Hopefully  I will get  some  reading and running done while I'm there.. 'cause I know I'm not gunna get any done when i get home.. well maybe a little but im not wasting the little bit of summer I have left on that shit.       Anyway.. I should get reading. My first book.. I laugh at myself.. haa ,0
  Today.. it was actually hot out.. I woke up late.. then tanned and hung around pretty much the whole day.. I got reading alot also.. I have a correction - I have actually read one book.

  I could only admire you from afar    Can never tell how I trully feel    I'd rather be silent  alone    Than to lose you forever                       Since I was in the early stages of my maturity  I have long searched for someone who would care for me. Often disturbed by the sight of have found themselves intimately  I strived to obtain a personal connection of my own. Because of the envy that consumed me at the time  I rushed blindlessly into the raging sea of affection. Not knowing the consequences it would have. And so it has engulfed me in its massive whirlpools of chance. Eventually  it drowned me in great depression as each opportunity failed.  I was lost  confused  and even desperate. But soon Ive found out the irrepressible truth that nobody could ever learn to love someone as hideous as me. Society  the same one who offered all ideas of emotional optimism  has created these conformities that forever embody sentimental cynicism and hypocrisy.  As said in a movie  Stripes for stripes Spots for spots  Shes a stripe. Im a spot. We could never be.  Maybe Im paranoid. Maybe Im delusional. Or maybe Im right.  I have grown much  learned many things and known much about myself as an individual  as well as my emotional capacities to handle situations. But no matter how much Ive developed  it will never please people.  A handsome face  a hot muscular physique  a nice sports car  wild sex - these are just a few things most people look for in a relationship.  Is she one of these people - people who look for the real essence of being together when they are not content with their partner or they have not sufficed there bodily appetites.  Ive only met her for a few months. We have spent little time together and Im still learning. Yet  my knowledge about her seems limited  thus disabling my abilities to fully please her.     This is hopeless!  I am paranoid! I do not know how and Im constantly afraid of the consequences my actions can bring.  I am delusional! Im hoping she will be with me as time grows and old and weary.  Alas  I am right! I have no chance to at all  So I worship you from a corner  wanting to tell you what I really feel about you. However  the thought of losing you weakens me even more.     Id rather sleep tonight crying Id rather be empty inside Id rather be soulless Than not see you again ,0

  i believe that there are some things in our better half that only us can see. No matter how people insists that they know the person inside out  i'll shot my ten cents to prove them that they are wrong.  this is such a sleepy saturday. i woke up so early and i have to be in the office by 10am. it's ninoy aquino's day... definitely  a double-pay holiday =) it's my kuya ed's birthday. but none of those made this day a special one for me. i've been so screwed for the past few weeks. bad break-up  scary starting overs  the betrayal of friends.. whew! but those were swept away by this happiness im feeling right now. what feeling can overcome the joys of being in love? yeah  same old  same old... just an ordinary story... for YOU! but this is a whole new feeling for me.  i fell in love with this person wherein from the start  all eyebrows are raising  all rumors are spreading  all comments and objections are flying in the air. i'm scared. but what the heck! knowing myself  i love making my life fussy. im interested with risks. and god! I AM IN LOVE! that's the most important reason  isn't it? and so the story goes...  along the way of our relationship  all the negative notes i heard from my friends about my partner that made me real scared are all appeared to be the opposite. things i heard are way far different from what i've seen. and what do you expect from people around you? again  the raising of eyebrows...and worse  they betrayed me when i least expect it. at first  it really hurts... but now  who cares?! anyway my other friend told me that i should trust my instincts.  today  i woke up early with a big smile on my face. knowing that this person proved that even the most devil creature has good sides too =) but oh.. im not saying that my partner is such a demon. hahaha dont get me wrong. i love her for who she is. im happy... very happy... ,0
"  it's right. love don't come easy. that's what phil collins is telling us in his song ""you cant hurry love"". and i always hear this line from my friend  jan. but this don't bother me before... until it came to me. however  i wont get tired of waiting for love to come. i know that even the reason i cried before was love  it's still love that will make me smile again.  hmm  why do i often caught myself smiling alone these days? well  maybe  the love is coming to me now. =) ",0
"  Labour leaders more often than not tell us how they will ""die in the Party"". Blair said that he wasn't born in to the party but he will die in it. I now know that this is a very useful device for making people rule out the idea of ever leaving Labour and it's a phrase that sounds good  and it's one I've copied and used myself for dramatic effect. But when it came to it  when this War criminal leader decided to throw in his lot with George Bush  stayiong in the Labour was not an option. What should have been the most difficult decision I've ever had to make (after 10 years flogging my guts out for it)  leaving the Labour Party was not only an easy decision but essential. How could anyone stay in a Party that stains itself in the blood of thousands of Iraqi civilians  dropping cluster bombs on them against the will of the UK and International community  against the UN  against the Law and for George W Bush  Rumsfeld  Cheney - Financial and War criminal one and all - and with the Tories  Berlusconi  John Howard  and Aznar.  We couldn't even be bothered to count the bodies. If anyone stayed in the Labour Party after Abu Graihb I wonder what they joined the Labour for in the first place. If it wasn't for justice and for an ideal that may or may not be obtainable  at least it was aspirational for humanity. I can't even begin to list the sheer number of crimes against people  society and democracy that this Labour Party has been responsible for and every single member is to blame. Your money has paid for a montrous  election winning machine that believes in privatisation  War and inequality. All the talk of saving the Labour Party from Blair is to miss the point. When a Party becomes part of the problem it doesn't deserve to survive. The dead children in Iraq will never be brought back. A new leader will not be able to lessen the personal pain I feel knowing that by helping to elect this Labour Government I also have blood on my hands. The Tories would never have got the votes in the Commons to conduct such a filthy War. Only a Labour Party wilting at the feet of it's Leader could have pulled this off. I will never rejoin the Labour Party and stand shoulder to shoulder with people who justify slaughter in such an ignorant detatched manner. My new pledge is that I will die outside the Labour Party.

"  I finally gave in. I spent six years in a Theatre department (I wasn't the most devoted student) and somehow avoided Karaoke  but last night I made my way down to the Bandana Brewery in lovely Mankato for Tuesday night karaoke. It was just as bad as I thought it would be. I know some people go for the comedy aspect  but to me it just seemed sad  not to mention new-countryish. I mean  I don't want to hear the Dixie Chicks sing a Dixie Chicks song; why would I want to hear tone-deaf drunkards sing a Dixie Chicks song. The one bright spot was the older couple who sang classic country. They had pipes. The guy did a nicely phrased version of  Folsom Prison Blues   and the woman did a sweet and sad  Crazy.  It almost made it worth sitting through the 5'6"" cat in shades who jerked his shoulders through Metallica. ",0
  Well  I bought my plane ticket back to Flint yesterday. It's going to be nice to see my family again. Of course  as soon as I had my ticket I talked to my sister and learned that home sweet home has become more disturbing than ever. It's hard for Flint to shock me--we're talking about a city that considered selling the trees in its parks for lumber  but I'm actually starting to get scared. A friend's cousin was beaten to death in his car in front of his eight-year-old son. One of the editors at the magazine my sister writes her vegan cooking column for was beaten to near-death and left in the street. Oh  and two women were found dead  one downtown and the other near Mott Park. Mott Park for God's sake! My favorite neighborhood in Flint. Where I always wanted to live. Where I went to school. Where my sister and brother-in-law just bought a house. I always look forward to going home  but this time I'm getting an ominous  horror-movie feeling. I'm learning to appreciate Mankato more and more. I think I'll just stay in Flint long enough to see  Hamlet  (which I'm sure will be excellent) and then I'll head to the Saint Clair River Delta  relax on the island and watch the freighters float by. Oh and play with as many dogs as possible before I come back to No-pets-in-every-lease-ville  U.S.A. ,0
  The first week of school was alright (other than the fact i've accidently hurt myself 5 out of 7 days! ) Clumsy me! It's now Tuesday and i have geometry homework that I do not want to do. I'd rather sit here and draw  listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers. I'm kind of mad because I found out that I'm not in govenor honors this year for art because I'm not able to take 1st semester art class due to me failing 1st semester biology last year and I have to take it again. i hope that made sense. Being a small sophmore really sucks because then i feel like people think I'm a freshman and being in biology again doesn't help. I can't wait til I get this school year over with. I have a feeling it's just not going to be good. Homecoming is early this year! and i don't have a date yet. Usually I would have a boyfriend to go with  but at the moment I'm single. I have like 4 guys in mind too.... but I really doubt I'd be able to go with them. I want the guy to ask me too... and i don't want to go to homecoming alone. :sigh: I'm just going to pray about everything and see where God leads me. Here is an abstract picture i drew around spring time ,0
  Hello!  This is my first post on blogspot and the first day of school. My language arts teacher told us about blogspot and how we all might make one. So I decided to go ahead and get use to it.  I never liked the first day of school because everything is messed up. I didn't even know what bus I was suppose to get on. This morning they told me something completly different than what I was told this afternoon. Most of my teachers are nice  which is a good thing of course.  I finally met my neighbor today! She's a junior and I've already met her brothers. They're all really nice. But now I dont have to ride the bus alone  so  it's all good!  I can't wait until FCA (fellowship of christian athletes) starts again. It's always an amazing experience and it's awesome because you're worshipping in school!  I will try to remember to post on this everyday. I will post some artwork once i find out how. ,0
  Okay.. a little about me. I'm married  with 3 lovely kids and an adorable husband. I have just taken a leave of absence from my job at The Home Depot. HD is a pretty good company  but all of the jobs are very demanding and most of my coworkers feel VERY overworked and consumed by their jobs. Before I worked at the store in my town  I worked at the Store Support Center (aka headquarters) in Atlanta  Georgia. I was involved in arranging travel for associates with the company  and also for assisting with employee/family relocations due to promotions/tranfers  etc. I really enjoyed my job in ATL  and miss my coworkers. Working at a store is a completely different world. I'm glad that HD hires people from all walks of life  different ages  colors  etc. But there is such a HUGE variety of experience in our store - it is very strange. We have 18 year old cashiers that came fresh out of the Kwiky Mart that wear their hip hugging bluejeans with the g-string underwear showing at the top and their boyfriends waiting on them out in the parking lot. We've got 55 year old experienced professionals that could build a house from the ground up with a crew of 3. We've got weekend warriors  firemen  schoolteachers  students  homemakers  who just want a part time job for a few extra bucks  and high school students working on the lot  pushing carts  and dreaming of making their way in to management one day. I guess VARIETY is the spice of life. And let me tell you - my store has a lot of SPICE. ,0
"  The HRM at my store is such a dipshit!  I'm taking a leave of absence (FMLA) and he tells me he needs me to come in and ""meet"" with him.  If I wanted to come in at his whim - then I wouldn't need the LEAVE OF ABSENCE!!! I'm not on the clock - I'm on a leave... He is so stupid and doesn't understand ANY labor laws. In other news  hubby and I are going to go to an auction to try and buy a house.  There is going to be an open house this Sunday so that we can see the inside of the house ~ I can't wait to see how it looks!  If things work out  we might be able to get this 3br/2ba house on over 5 acres for less than .... well  let's just hope that we can be the highest bidder.. ",0
  Okay  so I just registered because Tyler wanted me to post a comment and it wouldn't let me without registering  and so I said ahh what the hell I'll register. And now it wants me to post a fricken posting. SO this is it. So there. ,0
  Well  yesterday night was a ton of fun. We stayed up til about 5:30am or so talking about stuff..yeah that's right. STUFF.  Anyway  then I came back home and took a nice nap.     Anyway  I'm reading The Catcher in the Rye now...I took a few days off of it so now I'm perhaps a little behind :0)     oh well.     Yes  um.     Bye..... ,0

  hmm... first time having a blog... guess i should start off with something interesting...  I started this blog because  i don't know  maybe bacause i really want somewhere to be able to write my deepest thoughts  my deepest feelings. Also  as someone has been pressuring me to have a blog  i guess that's why i finally gotten this blog. Umm... i'll keep this post short as i think i can foresee  my other post will be quite long. Whatever i will write here  for anyone who will ever sees my entry  please bear it ijn mind that  whatever i write down at that time  those feelings only lasted that long  negative feelings that it. Positve ones of course will last longer.  I think i'll end my post here. Adios... ,0
  Came back from school today  felt so tired. Evonne nowadays very good to me  like treat me as a close fren like that. Wonder why  when i have never even talk to her when she was in school. Oh  i knew her when she was in school  but it's like  I know her name but i never tried to talk to her. Her bdae and Hanson bdae just passed. Wished both of them the happiest bdae ever.  Missed marcus alot. Never imagines that it would be so hard not to hear his voice telling me to take care and that he loves me. Michelle told me that she wonders why marcus broke with me when obviously he still care alot for me. Frankly  i also don't know. But  i'll be waiting. he promised me that he won't let me down. I'm scared i'll turn out to be something like michelle in the end. But... i'll cross the bridge when i come to it.  I'll end here today. Bye... ,0
  Lolz... Marcus got a B3 for his 'O' levels MT. So happy for him. Tols him this Sat can go his home  he sounded so happy. Don't know he ask me go his home for what. but i think i can trust him. No  i believe i can trust him. But  if he let me down  i don't think i will ever trust anyone again. Scared already.  Got back my bio paper yesterday. I failed by one mark!!! Haiz... i aiming for bio-medical course. my bio cannot go down!!! Must work harder than ever.  Tired. Don't want to write anymore. End here then. Adios... ,0
  So.... welcome everyone! Yes... after reading many people's online journals  I have decided to start my own online journal.  Today  nothing happened today. I woke up around noon....pretty early for me. I had some ice cream for brunch. My sister needed to go to NOVA to drop off some work to her teacher so i decided to tag along. It was a pretty scary experience; In order to make her 5:00pm deadline  which was thirty minutes away  she sped down the highway like a mad woman. But we made through it.  Afterwards we went to Blockbuster to rent Kill Bill: Volume 2. Normally I despise Blockbuster and I would never support them  but I got coupons in the mail for $0.99. So I finally got the movie and went home....really exciting.  My mom wanted us to clean the house from top to bottom and we promised here that we'd do it. The hours went by and we hadn't gotten to it yet. I pop in the Kill Bill DVD instead. I thought it was pretty good  but i have to admit that some parts were kind of random. My sister was confused the whole time...she usually doesn't get movies like this.  After the movie was done  we realized that it was close to midnight and we hadn't started on any of the shit that we were supposed to. We do a lot of cleaning and finish up around 1:00am.  I apologize for this extremely boring entry but my sister insisted that I start my journal today and nothing interesting or exciting happened.  Oh yeah....I got my senior pictures in the mail today! It actually turned out pretty good. Now I have a dilemma because the slowasses that were taking the pictures took over four hours to do their job and I had to go to work so i left before I can take my outfit pictures. So now i had to reschedule another day so i can finishes the pictures. I don't understand why i have to go out of my way to do have another appointment when those slutty whores at LifeTouch fucked up.  I'm excited because in two days I am flying down to Nashville. I haven't been there since the Christmas holiday and I can't wait to see my family. On that same day  the twelfth of August...it's my birfday!  AGAIN....sorry for this really boring entry and I promise that it will get even spicier!  AND CUT! ,0
  I have always wanted to write a book. Just like I have always wanted to finish college  and be a movie star and get married and have kids and own a trampoline. Ooh  and I wanted to be my own boss and be able to take off work whenever I want and not have to make up a reason for calling in sick.  I have accomplished a couple of those things  but not the book. Not yet. I love to tell stories about the things I saw when I was a child. Most of them are true  and some are simply told through the perspective of a 10 year-old's imagination that has become true to this 25 year-old woman. Do you want to hear them? ,0
"  It was summer - the leather seats on my Granny's navy blue Cadillac were hot and sticky.  Going to the bank with Granny was a normal kind of errand for me and my little brother.  The First American Bank tellers were very kid-friendly; they always sent suckers for us kids when they sent back the money for Granny.  On this particular day  Granny had a telephone set in the floorboard of her car.  She was the queen of mail-order catalogs  and she had gotten this red telephone  with a red cord and handset  from one of the many catalogs that filled the end tables at her house.  The phone had big black touch tone buttons  and I was amusing myself by making lots of clicking noises as I ""dialed"" familiar numbers.  In 1987  my 8 year-old self was impressed by the thought of a phone in the car.  No one that I knew  like my parents  family or friends  owned a car phone.  As we rode down Nolensville Road  dialing those numbers made my imagination wander and soon the receiver found its way to my ear.  I became lost in a whirlwind of conversations.  Instantly  I became a wealthy young woman (since I had a ""car phone"")  who was talking to famous people like country singer Reba McEntire or actor Patrick Swayze.  Patrick called me right as we pulled up to the teller at the bank.  Granny would have to get my sucker for me today - I was far too busy talking with Patrick about doing a movie next month to stop and wave at the smiling lady behind the glass.  I felt so important.  I rode around talking on my car phone for at least two weeks  until my brother pointed out that you could see the cord  and that made me look dumb.  He was just jealous that Reba didn't want him to come over and go swimming in her new heated swimming pool. ",0
  Ah  what a tangled web we weave.  To say im involved in some sort of bizarre love triangle would be overdoing it.  But  in a sense  maybe thats what it is.  In order to sort this out  I should start from the beginning.  I was working in a rehab for brain injured adults when I met her.  She was a petite spunky girl recently arrived in the area from california.  Some how or another  she showed interest in me and begain inviting me places outside of work.  I didn't really care  I was a student supporting myself and dealing with roomate problems  housing problems  getting to class on time  getting to work on time...the whole in and out of survival.  But  while im not all that great at subtle hints  she was aggressive enough for me to pick up on the fact that she liked me.  And so  after a long night of drinking and a bit of passing out and *unkowningly* spooning her  our relationship began.  It was cool  did all the great things you during a new relationship: trips to the beach  visiting the family  staying up late talking  holding hands  doggie style sex...(heh).  At some point  irresponsible as we were there was an abortion.  I dont want to go into here how bad that affected me; for her  I can only imagine it was much worse experience; but  it was her request and I supported it.  I do know having to walk through a thong of anti-abortion assholes didnt make it easy at all.  Not to mention I wanted to choke the living hell out of a few of em.  Time passed and the relationship seemed good.  Then  one day  she told me she was moving back to california and wanted me to come after I graduated in a semester.  I wasnt too sure about this; but  I agreed.  She left.  Afterwards  I continued to go to school and doubt settled in.  Perhaps I should break up with her?  Next installment....I move to california  relationship ends  we become friends...and then the web grows more complicated.... ,0
  So here is my first blog.  Couple of fun things going on  which I'll probably mention in some later posts.  But  looking for a new apartment.  This is always is always an epic adventure.  Another  new girl in my circle of friends.  We shall see how that turns out.  And when you gain a friend sometimes its good to loose a friend. ,0

  I'm mentally preparing myself for my journy into Western Psyche. I told myself that Monday  one week from the last time I went  I would return.  So I now wonder what this will be like now.  Seeing her again.  I did blow her off. But I have just given myself the time I needed to get my mind back in order. This one week crawled by.  Seemed like an eternity.  I woke up this morning.  A gagging noise  then a forced heave as I stared blankly at the ceiling.  Too scared to move.  Then a surryingoff and the patter of  little kitten feet.  I knew that my cat threw up on my damn bed. I slid my feet up  and boldly looked down.  Yes indeed  but not just a small pile  a stream across the whole quilt.  At least four feet long.  That was it.  I just got up. 6:30 AM.  Went downstairs and watched All in the Family recordings.  Damn funny show at times.    I am falling deeper and deeper in love with Sarah Vowell.  I learned a few days ago that she is an Athiest.  She is a Democrat.  She is my oasis in this world of unlogical happenings. She is so beautiful. I will marry her someday  I know it in the deepest parts of my soul. The sticky parts. ,0
  Each raindrop not only soddens the ground more  but makes my mood more and more solemn... It gives you time to brood with cold toes and numb hands. A loss for words though  with such a think haze over everything. You walk out side to be speckled with drops of mist. The wind bites your skin in this Pennsylvania August.  Sarah is in the hospital. I am reluctant to visit her. I have more important things to do. Or not. I'm simply proving my strength by rejecting her. I blew off a girl in the hospital. I destroyed Tuesday's visiting hours for her. It just sets in how evil that sounds. I was in the area twice since. Neither time have I visited. It is sweet karma though. Upon her whole family. Her brother is in a sanitarium in Utah  she's in one in Pittsburgh. Ah  the beauty of having copious monies. ,0
  Welcome to RueStVincent. My new blog and personality.  I'm finally away from that goddamn Xanga. Too popular.  I like this one's style though.  It will be bad that my friends are not in the same blog though.  Sucks for them though.  I like Blogger better. ,0
  I'm falling head over heels for you I'm not ashamed  just afraid of you I'm running away from love and from you I don't have anywhere to go but to you What do you want me to do I'm falling head over heels for you  I saw you sitting there with your friend I didn't know how to talk to you but then You looked over at me and you said hi There it goes  my heart just had to fly I acted cool  calm and collected I knew that I wouldnt be rejected You felt the same way about me And I knew that this could really be Something amazing and wonderful Looking around  I didnt see another girl I caught him  he is mine Leave me alone  I am just fine  I'm falling head over heels for you I'm not ashamed  just afraid of you I'm running away from love and from you I don't have anywhere to go but to you What do you want me to do I'm falling head over heels for you   I'll finish this song later! ,0
  You meet a man   And realize he's been in your dreams   Although you've never seen him before   He stands in front of you now   And yet   He doesn't see you the way you see him      You seem invisible   You check to see if you're still there   You see a motionless body and a sad face   You see pain and you know you're there   And yet   You still seem invisible      You talk to this dream man   Is he listening?   What are you saying?   The salty wetness runs down your face   And yet   Your skin is dry      He opens his mouth   Is he going to say something?   Does he know you're there?   You become eager for what happens next   And yet   He just yawns      You turn around and begin to walk away   Your face is red and embarrassed   Your heart is full of shame   Your dreams are shattered   And yet   He follows you      Where are you going?   Why is he following you?   You look behind you   He turns around and walks the other away   And yet   You can't move      You watch him walk away   He becomes out of sight   You can move again like a bird   You walk in the opposite direction of him   And yet   You can only dream ,0
"  I'm just tired of being in this constant state of flux. Nothing is ever enough and nothing is ever right. I want it all and I want it to be better than the last time. I don't really know why I am doing this  but  I suppose I just need to start opening up my life. I need to be ready for the next step  no matter what that is.  I feel so trite.  How did happiness and  enough  ever become a bad thing? When did I become conditioned to want and feel that want become ""need""? Again  it almost hurts that I'm so transparent. Yet  I say nothing. Ironic. I guess that transparent is the wrong word...More like childish  silly and empty. Nothing new to say  nothing new to share  just raw. ",0
  sensory never whole Next to me  in me warm body  warm bottle  Do I get to feel?  smoky intangibility questions more than answers  the trite mantra of my life. illusions perpetuated by those around me willingly I go able to walk convinced of my path mind games to obvious to entertain  laughable  usual stale.  not ready to dream yet. not hard dreams. Dream hard  dream fast  dream loud.  heart in my throat ready  i need to cough. excuse me. almost there. Getting therealmost there gone  feel fucking emotion shit. Physical i need to be on fire  Unmasking  Peeling  crazy  fear  need vacant ,0
  I can't believe how hung over I feel today. Yet  not an ounce of booze has touched these lips. I think that it was the coming off of travel and the lack of sleep. It almost makes me giggle  that this same feeling of apathy  stomach turning and headache can be caused by something other than beer. It's also an emotional hang over of sorts. I suppose it is the factor that I was just feeling so much yesterday...But I did not want to feel...At least not on the inside. I miss sensory feeling. I think that I have closed myself off so much from the world that I have protected myself both emotionaly and physicaly. I think that the phyiscal ramifications come first...it's much easier to lie to your head than to your physical self. I truly don't really know what I'm talking about. But  it seemed to make sense at the moment. ,0
  i was just watching apocalypse now and ive realised that napalm is your friend  your very best friend  and she will care for you- she just wants your soul first  here's how to make her:  the last time i made it  mine was very basic- 1 part gasoline to 2 parts animal blood. This solidified into a type of gel  not very stable ( a bit like me) but lethally flammable and sticky.  But a revised method is to pour some gasoline into an old container and force it to eat up styrofoam-you can even use the little white balls from the inside of a bean bag- untill it wont take anymore  this dries into a form of foam itself  with a wet slice at the bottom  tie some into a soggy ball and wrap with cling film to seal it and you have a perfect pocket rocket for throwing into a car window or something else that wants to burn  you could even hook up a basic fuse into it and run away  very fast indeed  because if you have tied the cling film on tightly enough it will just explode big time  superb. ,0
  i think i have a fairly violent and destructive nature  the other day i saw a work line of ants crossing this little path in my garden  you know all in a little line carrying leaves and other small pieces of debris to there nest.   so i decided- without conscious control or empirical decision making- to follow the line and find this magical nest of ants and well  to destroy them. its not as if im a child still so there was no real explorative adventure kiddy stuff  just the pleasure of destroying their city.  so i went to the garage- found a high pressure vacuum suction hose attachment and pressurised some diesel fuel into there home  i was quite surprised as about a gallon went in  along with a flaming book of matches- and i threw a bible in just for good measure- good kindling really  nice thin pages. anyway so this massive jet of fire shoots out and almost cooks me  and the most satisfying part was that NO ants came back out  i let the ones working in the chain across the path live just so they could go and tell the other colonies what had happened.  i was quite disturbed by the enjoyment i got out of the whole thing  but well the world is full of wierdo's that do a lot more worse stuff  so im ok  right? ,0
  But this torch that I've found  it's gotta be drowned or it soon might explode...Make it one for my baby... and one more for the road... ,0
  This is where you'll find most anything about me... but barely everything about what Im not.....yes  its confusing even for me... ,0
  I hope I can keep closer to them in the future  and they let me witness how their child grows... ,0
  Well  there's nobody online to talk to. So I figure  mise well talk to myself. I've seen a few of these things around and It's always interesting to see what other people do. Not saying that I'm all that interesting  but  oh well.       Today not alot happend. Woke up  played Nascar Thunder 2004 for a few minutes. Short attention span  so that didnt last long. Me and phish went outside and I threw the ball for him for about an hour. Then Ralph called and I went to his house and we just fucked around. We walked up to spads and hung out with Brady Crights and Eric...uhh I forgot his last name. Oh well. Went to McDonalds for dinner cuz dad was to lazy to make something....Now I'm here. Sitting on the computer...Talking to myself. Anyways  I guess that's all for now. Peace.      Casey~ ,0
  Bored  so why not post again. Nothing exciting going on. Went to my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary sunday  that was worse then getting teeth pulled. Spend monday and most of tuesday at the uncle's house. May move in there after school starts  we'll see. Already have my own room and bathroom there  plus a dresser full of clothes that are mine. So  it's worth looking into. New school  but  hey why not. Tomorrow hanging out with some people got lucky and have thursday off too. Who knows what Ill do. More later. ,0
  Bored  so  again  why not post. Not alot really happend. Went to my grandparents 50th wedding anniversary Sunday. You'd think after 50 years of being married they would have something INTERESTING to say. But no  not MY family. Boring stuff there. Then I test drove the Camaro that I'm trying to buy. Fun shit there. My brothers eyes were so huge when I was peeling out and stuff. I loved every second of it  trust me. Then sunday night until tonight  tuesday  I was in south lyon at my uncles house. Worked my ass off but he bought my hungting license and all my tags so that saved me $75.00 so I guess I cant complain. Came home and talked to shelbz about some people for awhile  nothing better to do. Trying to figure out where Brandon is  I think he's at his moms which sucks cuz I have the next two days off with nothing to do  and Ralph moved/is moving so cant go there. Oh well  two days of rest I guess. More in a couple days. I dont do enough in a day to post daily :) ,0

  Hello and thank you for taking the time to visit my blog. To begin I am 27 years old (on 8/18/04) am I divorced father of three wonderful children whom I love with all my heart and soul. My oldest son Nick is soon to be 8 and his hobbies include looking for creepy crawlies just like every other boy you may know. Kassandra is the next in line she is daddies princess at 6yrs old she's pretty much like any other little girl bent on making boys fall before her feet while looking sweet and innocent. Then there's Tyler 4 the youngest of the group and the cohort to Nickolas anywhere nick goes so goes Tyler. As for dad well i'm into drawing fantasy art  golf  and reading the Holy Bible as I try to follow gods commands for my life. Now as I said I am a divorcee I have to mention the one woman that has come into my life and helped restore order to an otherwise stressful life Amber my fiancee as of 6/18/04 wedding planned for summer of 05. Amber is the spark in life that has opened my eyes to life after divorce she has brought to me what it's like to be truely happy in an otherwise dark world.I lOVE YOU AMBER AND KIDS ,0
  Well  ok it's now sunday at 9:38 pm the thought of another week of work comes to mind making me relize how much i appreciate the weekend even thought it's just as busy as the work week. this weekend we had a birthday bbq for everyone in my sunday school class we had 17 people not including kids all in a 2 bedroom moblie home(kinda like packing as many sardines as possible into a small tin can)  but to my surprise it worked. As another birthday comes and the candles are lit the hope that the fire department won't show up also comes to mind as much as i love fire trucks they have a tendency to ruin cakes. Wow that makes me feel old i need to relize that i'm only gonna be 27 but at this stage in life i have already gone through alot of the muck on this world that i don't wish upon my worst enemy  and besides your only as old as you feel right...Besides i still have one thing that means the world to me my kids and my future wife and the knowledge that no matter what happens in life all i have to do is cry out to god and he will carry me through it all...I shall continue to keep you up to date on all the happenings in life just continue to check back....LOTS OF LOVE TO THOSE WHO CARE ,0
  Well today is Augest 14 and this is the first posting of my first blog ever and I will write alot everyday so check back every night for some reading if your bored! Well first let me tell you a bit about me and where I live... My name is Trevor Nederlof I'm 15 and I live in a town called Westport which is in connecticut. I have a younger brother (Andrew) who is 13 as well as a black lab (Chloe) who is 10. We just moved to a new house near a river which goes through our small sized town. I am a geek because I love computers but at the same time I have a strong love for sailing... every type of boat may it be 10-150 feet I have done it all and love every moment of it.                 Last night I saw Aliens Vs. Predator which was a great action movie and I recommend it to everyone. Then I woke up at 3am to watch my cousins boyfriend artor  row in the olympics on a 2 man boat. I was tired when I awoke at 8am I started to unpack my room and help my cousin Jake who works for my mom take alot of the boxes from our move to the dump in town. I met my best friend David Brenner  (Everyone calls him Brenner) in town and we rode on bikes back to my house where we watched Da Alie G Show which is the funniest show EVER. After Brenner left I basicly just played computer games while helping my aunt and grandmother with the boxes from the move. Well Pizza will be here soon so I should go...           Look forward everynight by 8pm est (1 am GMT) I will post on my blog and I hope you all share with others so they to can read my life lol. Until tomarrow enjoy life because you only live once :) ,0
  Well right now I am about to eat (yum) so I will make this a bit shorter than normal especially becauce I had a boring day. I woke up at 6:30 am :( and I at some breakfast and started to fiddle with my computer trying to get the network/internet in our new house to work. I had to work till noon cutting up the hundreds of boxes we used to move which is ok because I love my sharp knife :P The rest of the day I spent trouble shooting my home network trying to get it working with WEP encryption which most people will not know... ,0
  Okay my last post wasn't that fabulous but now i'm talking about my diet.  I lost 3 pounds.  Gotta lose 12 more before school starts.  I was doing good...until I caved and ate ice cream.  I must get back on track.  Not that I'm fat but I just need to loose some weight.  Must drop weight...must drop weight...must drop weight! ,0
"  Ah  today was pretty good. I guess this is my new blog. I like it. I'll type random stuff: what i'm doing  what I did  and jokes  and all because this is my personal space! Ok...heres what happened. Today I wake up come down stairs and the guy I have a crush on is sleeping on my floor...he was drunk! It was funny. So after he leaves he stops my like 6 more times.  THANK YOU GOD!!!!!! Well I'm glad for that. But my friend is trying to ""get with him"" if you catch my drift. Thats a bad thing. DUH! So  she asked his little brother out he said no...and told me YEA! Then after that she asked his other brother he said no...and now she wants HIM! But thats not gonna happen cause i'm gonna make my move. Because Every Hottie with A Body Needs A Cutie With A bootay! Thats my stuff. If you don't like it tuff bacuse thats MY DAY! So Plus i'm on a diet! ",0
  Okay i'm sad that the love of my life bought his girlfriend over today...but happy that the like of  my existance likes me back. ,0
  Today I found out that Bj the guy i've been obsessing over for like forever likes me back. YES! But also the other guy I like...I think LoVe brought over his girlfriend. We're really super good friends and now he has a girlfriend! WHY TRAVIS WHY!? But maybe I can just make my move on Bj and see what happens with that. I hope some thing good! He is soooooooooo hot. God Life is good. By the way. He slept at my house yesterday. Altho he was drunk! Today after he left...;-)...he stopped by like 6 times. Plus mi (i hope future) boi just bought a new car. Guess whos gonna need a ride...hint hint. Well tomorrow I make my move. WoW this is great...........I just wanna grab him and kiss him!! ,0
  Hello world!   Yes  well... umm... I've just started this journal  as you could probably tell  and I'm aiming to use it to record life as it is now for me. As for most journals  I haven't put this online to 'show it off' per say- I'm using Blogger because it's very accessible and so I can come back to memories and thoughts that I might well have forgotten in years to come. However  comments and everything are very welcome!   I hope that I'll be welcomed here well enough- I'm currently working on a layout of some kind that might come sooner or later... We'll have to wait and see!   Well  I suppose that first journal entries include a bit about the journaler  so I'll introduce myself  shall I? My name is Jennifer  but on the internet I go by the alias of Myth  I'm currently 16 and studying in 11th grade at a school in Brisbane  Australia. I'm more of a nerd than not  I guess you can say  but that's mainly because I need to study really hard to get where I want in life (in terms of a career) as I would like to become a physiotherapist  but I'm quite good at a variety of different things- I can write stories and poetry  draw to some extent and even defend myself  as I learn a martial art called  Ju Jitsu . My parents are separated  but I see them both equally  so it isn't that bad a deal  and I have two brothers- one twin brother and one half brother  who's currently six. He (the latter) is really cute  but he's also terribly annoying and (in m opinion) a little spoilt.   I like to RP (RolePlay)  mainly the online kind  so you can often find me in the RP sections of forums  or MUSHing on sites like  Elendor   but most of my time is lately spent in study or at Ju Jitsu training  which is really very fun  despite all the bruises.   Well  that's about all I can think of at the moment  so I'll be off and I'll post sometime later! I plan to try a very different style of journal writing  so I'll see what I can come up with! ,0
"  :Today was actually a good day! First I woke up around 8am n' I had to clean my room  if I didn't clean it then i wouldn't been able to go to the Summer Sizzler with my babi Paden! (which im happy i went but ill tell ya bout that part when i get to it lOl) Then I had to clean the living room up n' this was around 6:30 n' Paden called n' said he was lost trying to find my house n' my mom told his dad where to go  then they finally got to my house! Paden came to my door n my mom was like ""Come in Paden"" n' she was making me embarrassed saying all kinds of stuff lOl! But then we left n' got to the Summer Sizzler n' i thought no gurls that i knew were going to be there but it turned out Kori Penland was there! We had a blast sliding down those slides n' racing threw that thing! Korky cheated..this lil kid got in my way which I couldn't just push em down I had to wait n' that made her win so she was like ""Oh I won 2 times""! Cheater! lOl I still love yew Korky! Then me n' her went back and talked to Paden n' the other f*bawlers  then we all had to go in the thing and listen to Coach Ellis talk n' me  ; Korky were like what is he saying?lOl n' then Paden Me Korky Jake Luke Travis  n' other f*bawlers went back out n' played f*bawl! (I can throw it straight now..ya-yuh lOl) n' me n Paden were all huggy n' gooshy n' all that good stuff n' then we kizsed (1st kizs he*he) Then me n' Paden had to leave so we went to his car and waited for his daddy mommy  n' nanny in the car n' then he put his arm around me n' we kissed again (this was better then the 1st time) I was just like ya-yuh in my head lOl! Then his parents n' nanny got in the car n' we left n' they took me home n' Paden walked me inside n' he was going to meet my sister but she wasn't home so that sucked but then we hugged n' he said he'd call me tomorrow so ya-yuh! I love you so much Paden  your the best boyfriend ever and the sweetest! Well that was my day I'll put more of my days in here when I want to! Be safe n' I love yaw!: ",0
  I have tried the blogging thing and I am confused.  I am not tech savvy and my blog looks stupid.  I don't know how to add other blogs.  Oh well  chalk up another failed experiment. ,0
  I am sitting here posting this because I have been forced to by this lame friend of mine.  I have a boring life  I do nothing  I am nothing and I am sure no one wants to read about how I make my own babyfood and cloth diaper my child. ,0
"  So I have to be in this wedding in September.  I am trying to convince my friend Peter M to escort me to this wedding  but so far he will not commit to it.  My Hubby is going to be out of town on a camping trip so I am going to have to go solo if Peter doesn't go.  It is a Bolivian/Irish wedding.  The bride is about 5'2"" and the groom is about 6'4""  plus the groom looks about as Irish as Irish can get complete with red hair and freckles and the Bride looks truly Bolivian.  They are quite an interesting couple to see.   So the problem is that the only people I will know at the entire wedding are the bride  groom and bride's mother.  Most of the people on the bride's side are from Bolivia and speak very little English.  I know that this sounds like a very fun event  but if Peter M was the good friend that he says he is he would come and escort me ; )  Oh  here is the interesting thing:  The groom has multiple piercings.  Including his penis and testicles.  I am all okay with the piercing thing and everything  but I can't help but thinking the ding-a-ling piercing has got to hurt.  Oh and he did them all himself.  I asked the bride to be if urine and other bodily fluids leak out the other holes and she confirmed that they did.  Dude  that means his dick is like a freaking colander!  That is a bit strange to me.  I would be afraid to have sex with him (not that I would want to anyway)  for fear that some parts of his penis rings would come off inside of me and then have to be located.  Okay that would be just TOO CREEPY!  Okay enough rambling about nothing  anyway my daughter is crying and my husband is ignoring her. ",0
  It's Monday once again  after a short break over the weekend its funny how time flies nowadays and how you can never get things done  no matter how much effort or planning you've put into them. August is one month that I feel-the days and nights went by in a flash...  Was in the car  on the way to work earlier and there was this one Kancil  which was following me so close from behind. The unbelieavable thing is that  I was doing 140 and so how much was the chap doing? By the look on his face and the passenger sitting right next to him  I could tell that he's a student  studying in the college somewhere near my office or maybe he's a working guy. But they looked young and were pretty excited-being able to hog me like that. I gave way and they went so fast that  for a few moments there  I was praying that their tyre would go *FLAT*!!! ...because they were not worried at all about their safety. Do they know that it's Kancil they're driving  not a bloody Mercedes and even if it is a Mercedes  it's dangerous still for a 17 year old kiddie to drive in such a way. I am not old but I'm not a teenager anymore  I have been there and done that...BUT...I didn't interfere with anybody's life during that time and I did it  with full consideration in mind that  I would bear all the consequences alone. On my own  of course parents are parents and they'd always worry about things  that you can't stop them. It's a natural instinct embedded in parents  a speacial gift from god. If not Moms would be walking around leaving their kids and home and shop at Malls...'Why bother about Baby Cemara? No   she'll be fine  she can drink her milk from the bottle by herself.She can suckle later..' We all don't what that  trust me. So  kids or teenagers like those I came across this morning  they're not really bad..they're just at that age where  they rule everything...Hope one of them will turn out to be a successful someone  if not all....  Got to work on something  will continue later. ,0
  i leave for the Youth leadership conference  at camp pendleton tomorrow. my dad is driving me up there cuz  i have to attend mt SAT prep course until 12:30. i dont really want to go to the YLC i looked at the website and it looks really boring. hey at least its only for 4 days. i cant tell that this is just the beginning of an extremely strenuous year...i mean with the SAT prep  the AP classes  RO  and college stuff. im already getting stressed.  Wow this a really boring post. when i get back ill make sure to put up more hott and spicy topics. ,0
  Bored am i on this summer's last sunday as  i attempt to make the best of whats left. So last thursday i got back from the JH Pendleton YLC  ...damn it was boring. despuite the boredom i did learn a thing or two about the American way. As you may know  ive been working on a few songs lately ( each of which is dedicated to a friend) and  ive kind of quit  on the funeral one and am at a roadblock  for Haleigh's. Ive completely changed everything about the one dedicated to Herumi. the lyrics are that of a lovesick ballad and instead of guitar and back up instruments  it is solely piano  but rather simplistic. strangely  i consider it my best love song  ive written and the irony is that the girl to whom i am writing it(Herumi) is not even my GF. i think i shall alter haleigh's as well. i guess the problem is that everything about it is too complicated...that damn solo.   despite my end of summer blues i do feel strangely enthusiastic about the upcoming schoolyear. maybe ill meet a nice  pretty  sweet  academically inclined girl whose innocence accentuates her natural beauty...but also strong..like it would take more than one bullet to stop her. it would also be cool if she knew how to play an instrument or knew carpentry or steel welding. damn..maybe  i should find a girl who works at home depot. Eh screw it  my two loves as of now are school and Rock n Roll..GO ABSTINENCE!  k so ive been saving up for a sniper air rifle. i shall get it soon. i cant wait to kill that damn crow terrorizing my dog. i swear i will shoot that things head clean off it neck.  well now i am off to the 32nd street Naval Exchange to get some new clothes. ,0
"  My first post in this new journal that I've opened and am right now trying to think of something interesting to write. My name is not Catelina  but I've had friends think that it was  because I get referred to it very often. My sister calls me Catelina Marguerita  and once when I told a friend that and I commented that I was an alcoholic drink  they said ""delicious"". It gains some strange  perhaps unusual responses.  I am at university at the moment  studying a bachelor of science and am presently contemplating where it will take me. In no way  whatsoever  do I want to be a Scientist or a teacher. I am enamoured with the idea of becoming a doctor  and believe that the glasses which I got a week ago will aid me in my quest to take up this occupation. Yes  I do believe glasses make you smarter; it's a nice way to look at things  isn't it? But  seven years is an awful long wait to take up when you're craving in the most facist sense to be away from the world of studying.  I saw a pile of Medical lecture notes on sale at the university book store for $1.45  and was so utterly tempted to pick one up  pay for it  and go and sit in on the lectures. Then  when I finally get there  I will know most of the content and will breeze through the course... perhaps.  I have lived in the same house for all eighteen years of my life and my parents have been married for over 30 years  which in this day and age  is an achievement in itself  seeing as so many of my friend's parents are divorced  separated or estranged. I have a friend  who has moved so often in her life and craves to leave the place where she lives right now and for a time in our past  was so angry at me  I have come to realise  that I didn't want to go with her. But what people don't seem to understand is that living in the same house for so long  with parents who still love each other and siblings who are not on anti-depressents  is a remarkable  albeit maybe boring  life. I cannot think of a place I would rather be  even if I have only been on a plane once in my life and that was six months ago. ",0
  Yesterday when I was browsing I found this link. How? I can't even remember  I was looking for something totally different. I started reading some of the blogs and since I've been so lonely lately  I decided to try to write some of things that come to my mind. One of the things that I can start talking about is how my life has change from last year. Now I'm single again. I got a divorce. I can't say all the fault was his but mostly yes  he cheated on me. I think the hardest part has past. Now I need to look forward and try not to think about ...what if? I did everything possible to save my marriage  because I have a little daugther and I wanted her to have a family ...forever. The same way I did when I was single (the first time). I'm so lucky to have the parents I have and the sisters I have. Now I appreciate all the efforts that both my parents did to keep us all together and happy.  (Today is the birthday of one of my sisters  by the way) So  the point is that all the perspectives I had about life changed with this tragic episode in my life. Really  everything I believed before is kind of ...gone. I just hope that divorce is not the same for everyone  because mine has been hard mostly probably because of the relegion beliefs I had. I said I had cause now everything looks so different. I'm so happy for all the people that has found love  true love  now I realize that having someone to share your time and ideas is one of the most imnportant things we can have  more than money. (Of course money always helps). Sometimes I think if I will be able to trust again  you know as a partner and find someone that I can count on. Someone to grow old and have wonderful memories  Do you think is there such a person for me? Last night I was thinking about all the relationships I have had in my life and always end up the same way. Men cheating or maybe is me being to naive.   I'm liseting Rod Stewart an old song  I like to liseting the oldies  well I'm not that young  I'm 43  although I don't feel so old. I like to exercise and do a lot of things with my daugther and her friends. I guess most of the tv shows I know are from Disney channel. An about movies well most of the movies for kids. I have had so many challenges in my life but definetely this one is one of the hardest to pass. I'll let you know how I'm doing later... ,0
  I came to work today  checked my e-mail and there sitting in my inbox was an e-mail.  An e-mail from someone I went to High School with.  Someone I haven't spoken to in about 8 years.  I got that kind of panicky feeling before opening it. I always expect the worst.  Was she going to tell me about some unexpected tragedy that had befallen her or a mutual friend or even worse relate how wonderful her life has been since graduating.  Of course  it was the latter.  She's married  has a house  baby on the way  and has a great job.  Oh my Gawd  I can't breathe....  How can I compete with that? I'm still figuring out what to do with my life and right now I'm not even close.  I have a boyfriend and we've been together almost 4 years but we have no definite plans of getting married. And kids?  That isn't even a thought.  We are in escrow now for a house but every day feels like we are periously close to losing it due to my bad credit.   Since I was born every step of the way has be measured out.  1.  Graduate High School.  Okay  Check. 2. Graduate College. Mmmm  Check. 3. Get a job. Alright  Check. Alright  now what?  I did all that sooo..... I'm waiting........... what's the next step?   MarriageHouseChildDivorceRetirementDeath.   Great can't wait. ,0
"  I've been having trouble sleeping.  Well  not really.  I can sleep allright but I have these Godawful dreams that wake me up.  They aren't even the scary kind that are at least interesting to think about the next day. Like ""What the hell did I eat last night that made me dream about long legged owls wearing blue jeans chasing me through my 1st grade classroom while screaming shutup"" No  I've been dreaming about work.  Usually  I have a row of figures from one construction bid and I'm trying to compare them to a 2nd bid.  How freaking boring is that!  But it creates a really restless sleep.  Then at 4AM  I am wide awake.  I feel so AWAKE!  More awake then I've ever felt in my entire life.  I could read a book on the ""Philosophy of Physics"" and still be wide awake.  I know because I tried.  Then at about 5am I drift off to sleep only to be awakened 2 hours later by the alarm.  I awaken feeling so groggy  almost hung over like.  And now it is 11am and I am so tired.  I ...just ....want ....to ....take ....a ...nap. ",0
"  Everybody's been arguing today  and it's driving me out of what little bit of my mind that I have left. First of all  my mom wouldn't take me and my boyfriend(T.J.) to the mall. That was only the beginning  though..I'm usually the arguing one of the family  but she's acting like a fleeting psycho today! i don't know or really even care why she's so mad  but she doesn't have to fly off the handle at everyone who crosses her path! It's really bad when she only has 1 or 2 days off a week  and I don't even want to be around her. things just seem so much peaceful when she isn't even here. I don't think that's a good thing  but I know that me and her DON'T get along  and i'm not as upset when she's at work. It really sucks that i wish she actually was at work. It's okay though  I get to go shopping and go to work myself tomorrow  then on Wednesday I get to go to church AND see T.J. I really like him..he's like the ""guy version"" of me..He listens to the same msuic  and likes alot of the same movies  sports  and stuff that I do. I just can't get over all that we have in common. I just hope he isn't mad that my mom hasn't let me call him back..i have to wait until 9 to do that. i don't see why we have to use stupid cell phones. I wish we just had a normal phone  and I wish we were a normal family..If I told my parents that  they'd be like ""well most of the time YOU are the problem""...Real good way to make your kid feel wanted  huh? Anyways  school starts back in a couple of weeks  so between school during the day  working at night  church on wednesdays and sundays  i probably won't be here that much anyway. *Yay* Plus since I'm a senior  I'll probably have alot of senior activities and stuff. Wow. I can't believe I'm going to graduate in june. This is exciting  but I don't know what I'm going to do afterwards..I guess i just need to worry about making it TO my graduation. I wish there was some way to make my parents understand me a little bit better  but I guess there isn't. Well  i don't know what else to say  i just hope i get to talk to T.J. or one of my other close friends  like Elizabeth  tonight...bye... ",0
  I'm sorry if you're unfortunate enough to be reading this...guess you got bored while talking to me. Anyways  my last blog died because i forgot my handle AND password and i forgot which email i used  so oh well. I'll update this one more  I PROMISE! Ok....  My name is Zack. Im a big band dork. I play trumpet in marching band and jazz band  and snare in winter drumline.  I'm a pretty laid back person almost all of the time. You've gotta piss me off pretty good to get a reaction out of me. I've been getting really close to several people in the past month or so  and hopefully one a little more than the rest. My goal is to spend as much of my senior year just hanging out with people as much as possible. uhh....what else is there....did i mention im a loser? lol really  i am...  Individual shouts: (IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER!) andrew h. : You dont seem as stupid this year.... Squirmy: Ditto  although you werent as stupid as the aforementioned character.... Colleen (aka dimples  aka nicotine): You're awesome  and i can't wait to see how stuff turns out rachel (aka pommer  aka twitchy): You're a good friend to talk to  thanks for listening to me be                                                             a moron mallory (aka featherhead): lol  you're just mallory...thanks for being fun and funny and talking                                                with me christy: we've been through a lot  and im glad things have finally smoothed out. i wish you and                 tim the best. joe: you're a kickass friend  WE MUST KICK ASS THIS WINTER SEASON! tess: you rock claire: you're very cool to talk to....and make up insane stories with while insanely tired on a tour            bus  Theres a ton of people that would be on this list if i wasnt so damn tired right now. Like i said  no order...in fact  after i thought of people in order i rearranged them. ,0
  my head is like a 2 year old's finger painting. it's just a buncha colors and hues all smeared up and stuff. so anyways. school is off to a really boring start. oh well  at least i wont have to work very hard. uhhhhh.....hm....either theres a lot going on  or hardly anything at all. ok  this post is really stupid  and it doesnt make any sense  so im gonna call it quits before i look even more stupid than i usually do.... ,0
  Hi there  my name as you can see  is Brock.  I've been looking everywhere for a place for me to express myself  Thank you blogger.com.  I'm starting this school year as a junior  just turned sixteen  not looking for a girlfriend  because i've found one...she doesn't know it yet though...well  i guess i'll create a profile now...if you want to know more about me  head there.  ps  this is what part of the alphabet would look like if q and r were eliminated. ,0
  I saw her again to day  but nothing more than a passing glance.  What i wouldn't give  to hold that girl...i've written her several songs  she knows how i feel about her.  But sadly  for me  she is already in a relationship.  So i find myself once again lost in this dark spiralling chasm  gasping for breath  hoping yet again to catch a fading glimpse of her beauty.....she's so beautiful.  My story is nothing but a speck in all of history  but it is still my story  and i won't let it end unhappily  i won't stop loving her  if indeed i do love her....there are many definitions of love  mine is wanting to just be near her  nothing more than to see her  but ohh this lonelyness is dark  so very dark...hopefully she will find her way to me  maybe  if i'm lucky...she's so beautiful. ,0
  Today was a good day...i went to church  learned some good stuff...and i saw you there.  You were setting there  as beautiful as ever  and i was happy.  Later everyone went to the lake  i enjoyed that  espacially the service  were i sat in your shadow.  If you only cared for me the way i do for you...ohh  what a love that would be.  I've been waiting for a while  but that doesn't matter  my feelings for you haven't dissapated  i doubt they will.  Your the first person i think of when i wake up  and the first person i pray for  before i sleep....what a love this could be.  countless hours spent dreaming of you  but whats sad  is that your in love with another  and there is nothing i can do to stop it.  But all in all  today was a good day. ,0
"  ""When exactly do we go from being kids to being just people  I'm not sure. I do know that it's not about turning a certain age or graduating from school. It happens when you're not paying attention. We go from playing with our friends to playing with our friends' feelings. Without our knowledge or onsent  childhood slips away in the night and our innocence escapes us and we wake up one morning to find who we are.""      it makes no sense to me. this all seems so confusing. our parents tell us that we aren't doing what we're supposed to be doing and that we are going to ruin our lives if we do this or that  when in fact they did it themselves and they turned out just fine. there's a ton of people out there that do drugs. i know what they can do to you  i mean i work with people at the Baker's Treat who are trying to get over what they have done to themselves. it not news to me that you can get addicted and that its bad for you and what not. i no this seems weird for me to be talking about but i have a point.      as most people know  i live under a rock. i don't go out all that often and when i do  my mom has to know everyone that's going and has to make sure that all the parents know exactly what we are doing. it's craziness. tomorrow i turn 16...friday i get my permit...a year from friday i will have my license and will be able to go out whenever i want to...or atleast i should be able to do that...but knowing my mom  i wont be able to. i don't see y i cant go out and just do what i want to do without being questioned. i've never been to a concert because my mom thinks im gonna get raped. im not allowed to go to parks with my boyfriend because she thinks im gonna have sex in public...yea like that's gonna happen. i actually do have morals...lots of them. even though i have borken like half of them but that doesn't matter...my mom doesn't trust me or my friends. she's in for a rude awakening my senior year...and probably this year when my friends all get their licenses...      if my mom thinking im gonna go out and get high and drunk she is wrong...i might do that once or twice but that's it...haha..but i dont no...i probably wouldn't even do it...i just want to be trusted for once...

  Yeah  season one is over. Im sad because we wont see new episodes for awhile  but..now I can watch the whole series from the begining. So  yeah.

Even if I have to host it on something else  it shall be down. Kyle  if you are reading this  give me a picture ;_;. Ill be up for another 2+ hours and then wake up early and be so tired and bitchy. I pity my family. ,0
  Ok  now Im getting pissed off   ;;;;      I have two weeks untl school starts and still no supplies. By the time I go  there will be nothing left  _ ,0
  Yeah  I cant think of anything.....probably because Im so tired....Making some new sig stuff  so stay tuned later...Ill have them up...sometime.

"  Thanks for being a fucking prick Nic  yes  excuse the ryhme. What the fuck is up wiith you? Today  I lost most of the respect I once had for you.  I webcamed with him. He says:  ""....ewwwwww.

Those are the kinds of things you keep to yourself   retard. Dont even comment on this  you really hurt my feelings and I dont want to talk to you for a long time.  Way to be a great friend. ",0
  Here I am.  Ready to start classes in two days.  I graduate this year.  I should have finished long ago.  But no.  I had to take two years off.  I had to go visit California and Oregon and spend time with Dad instead of being smart and getting a start on my life.   So here I am.  Ready to be me.  Ready to be someone.  Ready to start and finish.  Ready to be done.  Ready to be...what?  What am I trying to be?  Senior year of college.  Criminal Justice major.  I could go to law school.  I could try to become a police officer.  I could just give up this joke and be a social worker.  I guess I'm ready for any of the options.  I have an LSAT score.  I can't get into the school I want with it but I can try again.  Do I want to try again?  Who are these people?  Who are my friends?  Beth thinks we'll go to law school together and be all happy go lucky.  I'm not like Beth.  She's outgoing.  She's a free spirit.  She's ready to be single and alone for three years just to get that freaking degree.  I want something more.  I want to find someone to be happy with.  Then maybe I can be happy with me.  And there's Mike.  What the hell are we anymore?  I know you will read this Mike.  So why don't you tell me what we are?  Just tell me if it's a yes or it's a no because I can't live in limbo like this.  You love me.  You don't want to marry me.  You think I'm sweet.  You think we're good together.  You don't know if you'd be happy with someone else.  What the hell?  But classes start again.  And I'll try some more.  Perhaps this will give me the outlet I need to just be me.  To figure it out. ,0
"  Who said that books should cost this much?  Seriously  most of my ""play"" money I saved up from working all freaking summer was spent today on books.  Ok  not really MOST of it (I did save up a lot)  but it put a substantial dent in it.  $300.  Bastards. ",0

After the   4 hr   op everi was so somber n deep in sorrow!My couz told me dat my grandma looked so weak and her hands and both her eyes were swollen..My aunt kept crying n she said dat she can't forget the look on my grandma's face..She said da doctor told her to '  prepare for the worst  ' and to  '   dont stop praying   ' .Of coz..she became scared..So dat Sunday..i went  visit my   grandma.She's in ICU.These few days..gonna be in critical condition.When she saw me wif ma lil couz n ma aunt n we saw her..all of us burst in tears...It was so   saddening   to see her like dat.Wif god knows how many tubes in her mouth..nose..hands..lungs n whateva.It seems as though she was fighting for her dear life and she couldn't do it.Da pain she endured is clearly portrayed through her physical expression.I told her  be brave and believe that everything is gonna b all right.

  Blog. Short for we B LOG ? Or just another stupid semi-acronym invented for the 21st C.? Supposedly  these 'blogs' are the new 'journalism' or the new 'voice of a generation'. Just like the printing press in 1450  the telephone circa 18something (Google Telephone History  you'll see)  and cable TV in the early 70's.  Whatever.  I'm not sure if this thing will come to any valuable/relevant end  but I like to ramble in print  and being too lazy to keep a journal  this is perfect. Also  hopefully  this blog will allow me to argue with people. I love to argue  and if a good debate is presented  then I may take the bate.  I may just use this to post my drunken ramblings  but I may also use this blog for evil. There are folks out there that need to be taken down a notch.  Anyway  for tonight   Peace. ,0
  I'm not a Kerry fan. I hate Bush. I will vote for Kerry.  There  I've said it.  Kerry is not the do-all and end-all of the Alternatives to Bush.  The fact is  he is the Current Alternative to Bush. I would prefer to be passionate about who I vote FOR  as opposed to being passionate about who I'll vote AGAINST.  Unfortuately  the person who stirs emotion in me for this election is Bush  and that is who I will be voting against.  The War in Iraq has a little to do with my opinion  but truth be told  I liked Bush less than I liked Gore  so Gore got my vote.  Gore stirred zero emotion/feeling in my bones  while Bush made my skin crawl.  The little scumbag liar gave me the creeps.  From the day the Republican 'Party' announced him as their candidate  I was not going to vote for him.  That being said  the party that puts a STRONG candidate in the running will get my vote.  As it stands  the parties are putting candidates out who they feel will offend the least.  That's crap.  We don't need products who are easy to advertise.  We need leaders who will do the best for America.  Bush's entire tenure can be shown in a PowerPoint presentation.   That fucker is on vacation more than anything else.  Too bad the Democrats can't come up with a candidate who stirs more emotion than 'He's got to be better than Bush'. ,0
  Mom has really irritated me all day. She won't stay away from here computer long enough to pet me but 5 or 6 times. She forgot to put ice in my water bowl and then yelled at me when I tried to lick the ice in her cup. She forgot to leave the TV on when she left earlier so I had nothing to watch while she was gone.  And what really got my tail in a knot? Well Mom and Grandma sat here and watched some make fun of cats show right in front of me. As if I wasn't even in the room. I mean geez what do they think  I don't have feelings?  I think I will knead her arm extra hard tonight.  Meow! ,0
  I was traumatized today.      It was horrible.       Mom let me outside to play. I was having a grand old time. I teased the hamsters in their cage. The little balls of fluff just hate it when I paw the bars. They puff up and jab at me. Little buggers have a heck of a bite when the catch ya though.      When that got boring I spent a little time hunting bugs  though I have be careful to stay away from the rock garden and the flowers that attract the best bugs.      After my belly was full I started my rounds and was on the far side of the house when I was suddenly soaked. Rain came out of nowhere and I just got drenched. I had to sit and cry at the back door screen for five whole minutes before mom let me in so I could dry off in my bed.      I am still a little damp. I am not sure I will recover anytime soon.      I heard mom say that it is supposed to rain all week. I think I will stay inside  no matter how much I crave a good crunchy bug. ,0
  Happy Birthday Aunt. Mom says it isn't going to be very happy since you have a houseful of kids and it is raining out so they'll have to stay inside. Hope you survive. Oh and say Hi to Milo. OK Piddlepup too  but tell her not to try and lick me.  Mom said she ran my name in a generator thingy and it said I was infected by this:      Doctor Unheimlich  has diagnosed me with  Mrs. Kitty's Syndrome      Cause :  running too fast     Symptoms :  French accent  swearing  extreme absenteeism  extreme warts     Cure :  exercise     Enter your name  for your own diagnosis:         Does that mean I can't eat anymore ladybugs? Or maybe it means I could do a duet with French announcer guy  whaddya think? ,0
  once i was sitting in the school hall having the first pe lesson then i was looking around.when the teachers were preparing the stuff for the lesson i spotted a girl at the oppsite side of my class.I watched her and cared nothing else by then i realise she was my girl...once i met her at a bus stop she was with her stead but i didn't know that that was her stead.Thus i sat at a seat behind them and heard what are they talking about.then as time flies each time i looked at her the more i liked her even more.Then at mid august i finally got the courage n asked her for stead i was that surprised that she accpted me.then it lasted for a week plus a day.we broke up  she didnt want to hurt me cuz she had her ex in mind.somewhere at the last day of school i asked her for stead again then we patched up for 3 days and broke up again.because of the sparse communication..when school reopened we tried to act like nothing happened.but we still can't forget that we had the past together we were like steads we act like one and we got even closer to each other.On the 27th july we patched up.then kelly exposed our relationship and she was her best friend also my friend jac scolded her for doing this i don't know what happend and i actually tried to defend kelly.that dy  i sent her home we were taking bus 105 we sat in the same sit and held hands we treasured the time we had and that was only the time we had together alone.but on the 4 of august  we broke up she told me that she was a bad stead and broke up with me...then finally on the 7th of august she expained why...she again said that she was a bad stead and her parents n brother knew about our relationship..she wanted to protect me and she broke up with me..and she does not bare to break up  she was crying when she told me all this and there is nothing i could do to help.i can only see her tears rolling down her cheeks.then she took her bag and ran out of the school i felt helpless and started wiping..i hated the world to be so unfair to us..all we wanted i a stable relationship and nothing else..but in the end..we still have to go seperate ways...and each time i thought of she saying...i don't want to break up but i have no choice...tears will start rolling down my eyes..i did not give up once i will wait for the right time..i will always keep her in my mind forever... ,0
  My life as of right now sucks!  I mean  I broke up with Chasen  Brit and David broke up!  I just don't know what is wrong in the universe to make things go wrong all of a sudden!  I have a new boyfriend (Kurtis)  and I am not so sure that I like him that much now  but I am not sure what I should do about it! DOES ANYONE HAVE ADVICE?!?!?  I am still in love with Chasen  even though he has moved on  doesn't want to be friends with me at all  and he won't tell me what/how he feels about anything!  I really just don't know what I should do about anything!  Once again  DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY ADVICE?!?!?  And the school I am at now (Cocke County High School  Home of the Fighting Cocks) is okay I guess.  I mean  I meet a new person everyday!  I like my classes. There are some guys that like me and everything  but I don't know who and who not to like!  It is very hard work to be a girl now days!  Any ladies wanna agree??  Especially if someone thinks you look good.  Well  that is about all for now!  I will keep you posted almost everyday!  Talk to yuh later.  Love yuh bye  Crystal!  ::Kisses:: ,0
  Well  for a Monday  things turned out pretty well!  I mean  I hurt a girl's feelings (Kurtis's friend Cassie)  I think Justin is gonna ask me out  and i just wrote a letter to Chasen!  How exciting  huh?  Not really.  I didn't get to go to the fair Saturday because it rained most of the day.  I didn't get to go to the football game Friday because stupid Travus never called me back!  I am so mad at him by the way.  But what do I expect from Travis. I mean  it's him!  Anyhoo . . . I talked to Luke about Chasen and he says to just tell him the truth about how I feel!  Yeah  well  even if I did tell him the truth he wouldn't believe me or take me back!  That would be giving him my time that he doesn't need or want.  Kurits just called to say what's up.  How nice.  I made a buddy profile for my AIM screen name.  It is pretty cool.  I don't know.  I like it whether anyone else does or not.  Well  I am gonna leave for now.  I will probably be back later.  I am talking to Kurtis so I am getting kinda confused.   Hehe.  Talk to yuh later.  PEACE!  Love yuh bye  Crystal ,0
"  I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to write about on here. So I am just going to write about what I am thinking. I'm leaving for college in 8 days. I'm pretty scared because I have a great boyfriend that I have been dating for almost a year and two months. He is going to college about two hours away from me. We are both playing basketball so I'm not sure if we will be able to see each other much during the season. I am majoring in biology but I'm not sure what type of career I want to have.     Well I have been looking around this site and I can't find out how to look at other blogs. I guess I'm ""blog illiterate."" It doesn't really matter to me though. I don't mind if nobody reads this. I like being able to write about my feelings. I kind of actually feel like a dork for doing this. Oh well. Nobody will know! ",0

  Woo Hoo tonight is girls night! Since the bf is out of town! I'm going to watch Princess Diaries 2 with my mom  two of my friends and their moms. Then the girls are spending the night here. We definately will have a good time. Maybe I'll tell them about this. They could start one too. Maybe we could do one of those team things. My boyfriend called from Canada yesterday evening  he is on vacation. We only talked for a little bit because it will be really expensive on his cell phone. He said he was having a good time. I'm happy for him  but I miss him!!     Maybe I'll have time to write about our fun time later tonight. Or I will just wait until tomorrow. I know how bad everyone wants to read this.....yeah right!!! ,0
  Wow..isn't it wierd how you think you are really good friends with someone.  Then all of a sudden they are in a bad mood...so they decide to be rude.  I hate moody friends.  It's like what is the point of keeping them.  You never know from one day to the next if they are even going to like you.  One day they are the nicest person in the world.  The next you can't do a damn thing right.  Some of my friends are like that.  One in particular  and sometimes people decide to follow ,0
"  Hi  I'm Gabe's mom  Chrissi. Gabe [aka  Gabriel  bird  goo  goober] is my six month old son. He is a gorgeous little boy  he likes to eat  play  pull the cats' ears  coo  laugh  and nap with his daddy. Gabe also has spina bifida and hydrocephelus (sp?). It was quite a shock to learn that he had spina bifida. We went in for our 20 week check-up and everything was very normal. We found out he was a little boy and that he was growing well. At 28 weeks  i developed diabetes  that sucked  so we asked the doctor to do another ultrasound to make sure gabe wasn't getting too big  that was when we found out that his spine hadn't closed all of the way and that the ventricles in his brain were a little bit larger than they should be. Talk about overwhelmed  disoriented  and generally confused  we had no clue what the hell spina bifida was  let alone how we were going to deal with it! At 37 weeks  Gabriel was delivered by a wonderful team of doctors and rushed to the NICU to be prepped for surgery. For almost 2 weeks we couldn't hold him  nor could I breast feed  snuggle  or be very close to him. I think that the worst part was going home without him. He stayed in the hospital for 16 days. He had a shunt placed in his head when he was 14 days old. My husband was freaking out over the shunt  after all  they had to put it in his brain! Everything worked out fine  and he came home with us and we have been living pretty happily ever after. Ok  not quite  reality has a funny way of making the whole  ""oh look we have a cute little baby in the house  isn't this fun??"" be a little more like  ""holy shit  i never sleep  i've worn the same clothes for 3 days  and i smell!!!"" on top of this  we are dealing with a child who has to see special doctors  an hour away  i might add  and we are continually worrying about something going wrong.  The special doctors are still a reality  but we don't see them very often now  only about once every 3 weeks. Now at 6 months  gabe is a pretty normal baby. i am back to work at the Montessori school I teach at  and gabe comes with me. He loves all of my kids and they love him back. We are blessed that Gabe has a ""low level"" case of spina bifida  which means  he has bladder and bowel control  he will walk  and most people won't even realize has a birth defect! It still sucks  though.... ",0

"  Hey Party People!  So  in about 4 hrs. I'm going to wake up to start training for the LA Marathon.  All I can say is  ""Starbucks to forget!""  I'm excited about the marathon (it's my first) and right now my only goal is to finish.  It's quite encouraging that I'll be doing it with about 4 or 5 friends from work...including someone I've taken quite a liking to.  Well  I must attempt to get some rest in  but until next time  Ciao!     Question of the Day: How do you know if you are being driven by love or driven by fear? ",0
"  Well  I've never done a ""blog"" before so you'll have to grade me on a curve.  Today was another fun visit to the dentist.  Turns out  that tooth #27 (yes  it's that specific) needed a root canal.  To really be able to focus on that particular tooth  my dentist found it neccesary to use a dental dam.  All I could think of was sex ed. in high school talking about dental dams for oral sex.  If anyone I was with pulled out a dental dam  I wouldn't be able to run away fast enough.  My day was quite uneventful otherwise. Other news:  I am missing someone that is very important in my life. Recently  I had to ""restrict"" a friendship with someone I care deeply about because her fiance isn't such a big fan of me.  It really sucks but I know that things will work out for the best and that nothing is impossible :) Until next time  God bless and good night. ",0
  Well friends  it wasn't pretty but  after 3 hrs. of sleep I dragged my sorry butt out of bed to take on the mean streets of Venice  CA.  I joined my friends Samaya and Bianca to start training for the marathon.  We're part of a group called the L.A. Roadrunners (original  I know).  Do to a knee injury  I just walked today. Regardless  I'm very excited about everything going on over the next 6 months leading up to the race.  After training  we went on over to Robeck's (in the Nut) to toast our first day with shots of wheatgrass.  We even have our picture plastered on their wall.  It's not even noon yet and I've already had quite an eventful day.  Look for another post later today.  Until then  it's nap time! ,0
  Today   i feel qutie happy as i got noe most of my result and they all score better then i thought so very happy .  I pass  my A math  which i fail every time. I am so happy.

  Today  i got english result and i fail lah. got a scolded by my mum . dun wish to write anymore . ,0
  I had nothing to say about this writing. It comes suddenly in my mind but it also because something has happens during that day.  I know what I am  who am I. I cant be myself even its me somehow. Confused rite?? I want changing. I want to change my life.  This day something happens. For the moment I want to screammm.. and cry but I cant. Why?? I forget how to cry anymore. Whats wrong with me?? Why I cant overcome myself. Its that fear that I scared. You asked me what the hell do I want?? I dont know anymore. I just like normally people  want everything. But why I cant?? Is that my fault?? Am I that boring?? But I supposed I also have that kind of chances right??  Flash back. We just met a few months ago. I thought we could be a good friend. But now I realize that just a dream  sweet dream. I am just realizing that there is no chemistry between you and me. I never enjoyed when I with you. Is that because of the chemistry?? I think yes because no matter what I say  what I do its wrong in your eyes. Am I really that clumsy?? I wonder do I really look like that?? Why I cant overcome myself. Its that fear that I scared. Can I let go my fear?? Oh God  I never asked you anything. I just want to be loved. Is that wrong?? Am I asking too much??  Oh please someone tell me what am I supposed to do. I am also a human too. I need love and loved someone. Do I have any options left behind?? I think answer of all this question is giving me a time to change. Change into what?? Do not ever dream that I would ever beg you to come back or kneel on my knee. Tell you I have my pride and I wont let you pity on me. No matter what  I will survive. I am not asking you to come back I just wonder.. Have I done something wrong??  You once said that I am too kind. Is that wrong to be kind?? Whats wrong with that?? I dont understand. Is that making you sick?? And I want to know whats wrong to wear mask and to be somebody else who is better than me. Even its not me but now its parts of me now. I thought what the most important is just do whatever you think is right. I dont care what people say about me. Let them say anything they like. Makes them happy. Or are they jealous with me?? I wonder.. Outside I might seem perfect and happy but dont judge the book by its cover. No bodys perfect so am I. So what do you think of me now?? ,0
  i just bought a home hiv test kit from drugstore.com.  actually two.  and a bottle of wet platinum (that's stuff's yummy.  makes any session of self-love feel like you're 14 again...  but maybe that's not a good thing.  hm...)  of course  i didn't really NEED two tests nor the lube  but man i'm a sucker for bargains and i saved a whopping three cents for spending fifteen times more than i intended to.  i'm a bargain shopping stud.  the package arrived yesterday at work but i didn't want to prepare my blood sample in a shared bathroom stall.  so i thought i'd do it after a rigorous game of bowling.  and you know how much bowling gets the heart pumping and the body ready for blood sample extraction!  you basically have to prick your finger on these little plastic apparati.  of course  i was too afraid of getting pricked  so i couldn't get enough blood out of my middle finger from the shallow wound i created.  so instead  i doubled the pain by additionally having to prick my ring finger to get enough blood to fill this circle on the sample collection card.  okay  okay.  it really wasn't that bad.  i've learned to type with eight fingers quite rapidly.  no  really.  it's a lot better than getting blood taken out of your arm.  that's for sure.  the last time they did that  the nurse bruised my arm and it hurt to masturbate.  i knew i should have given the nurse my left arm...  but i'm really one big fuck up.  i just got tested a month ago.  but since then  i fucked this guy bareback and then got hit by a flu that came out of nowhere.  and this guy i screwed apparently is allergic to latex and doesn't always have safer sex with his partners.  and did i mention i already have a boyfriend?  i can deal with fucking up my own life  but when i start affecting other people's lives  i totally feel like shit and deserve more than just a couple of pin pricks on two fingers.  i can't even be straight about it.  here i am recounting my home test kit experience with witty embellishments to hide the fact that i'm a complete failure.  i can't bargain shop  i can't prick a finger  i'm a cheat  and i can't even honestly post an anonymous blog.  but at least i saved three cents.  and got free shipping. ,0
  I'm bored but strangly happy today. I did nothing today (except workout) and it was awesome. My color is Copper and I taste like honey. I like that; better than tasting like copper. Honey is sweet  so I think it fits me well; however it is also sticky and annoying. I shall ignore those attributes of the honeyness. But honey is pretty...and well  we've been over that before. And if you don't know what pretty is  pretty = hot. I know  I know; it's all very confusing. Just know that when a girl calls you pretty  its not that bad of a thing (Most of the time). My alarm clock just went off...how odd.  Julia called again  dont really want to talk to her. She and Crystal came out on Friday after the Fair fiasco. I went to Tiffany to escape them. I prolly would have had a VERY VERY good time  but I don't want to have the pressure of that looming over my head  should I decide to never speak to them again. Sure  Im not going to turn it down if its  right there   but with both of them here it would have been weird. Don't ask why  it just would have. Tiff says Im turning into a man slut. I disagree.  If these are the best years of our lives  I'm-a-thinking preimptive suicide may not be such a bad idea. I mean  just cut off the pain early  ya know? Nah  I wouldnt ever do anything like that  but it is an interesting theory. I do like to get things done early and death is a thing. heh. Don't know where this is going  but thats whats kinda cool. I think this is better than a Xanga. Kody's profile says that no one cares what I do all day. Well  shit   I  don't care what I do all day. These aren't really for others to read  I mean they are  but they aren't. I see them as more of an outlet; for me atleast. I need money and I need alot of it. If I had money chicks would dig me. They would  they would. I need money  a cool hair cut and leather jacket. Hell  I wanna be The Fonze. He's one cool nigga. He can walk into a room  get some kickass music playin  some sweet chicks and get free food. Yeah  I wanna be the Fonze. Well  Im all out of brain power.   Copper / Honey   Out. ,0
  *First post Matt  come on  make it count...ok ok breathe  just breathe  calm down....ok  1  2  3  Team!*   Ok  this my first blog and my first introspective blog pep talk. Well thats that with that  I'll post more later. ,0
"  Hey I am Casie and I am 15 years old  a sophmore in High School. I go to church at FBC in Harrisburg where I live and have been living for 5 years. I am a nice person I think  or well I try to be sometimes it just doesn't work out. I am a very quiet person until I feel I know you and then I will talk your ear off. I live with both my parents and My little brother Ethan who is 9 years old and in the 4th grade. I love music and basically listen to anything I have handy but I really love the punk rock emo stuff. My favorite bands are Dashboard Confessional and All American Rejects and my favorite song at the moment is ""Memory"" by Sugarcult. I love writing that is one of my biggest passions besides photography. I am basically a fun loving person.      And without my friends I would be no where... I know I can depend on them to be there for me and they know I will be there for them. Some of them are:      Melody you are my twin sister seperated at birth and my bad influense     Hannah  Bitch number 2 (I am number 1)     Jenn  my cousin and advisor     Tristyn  big sister     Molly  pollywog ( i really think we lead parallel lives)     Shawna  such a quiet person but really a big goof ball     Sam J you're sweet  crazy at times but awesome     Rachael you're there for me all the time      Aaron you are somone i never met but i feel like I have known you forever.     Blake you are someone who can make me smile when the world is coming down around me  you're so mean tho especially in those truth or truth games :P ",0

"  they say the best things in life are free.  i am inclined to believe whoever ""they"" are  though it's more like i NEED to believe them.  i'm starting this blob as a means to chronicle my struggle with the green  i.e. marijuana  and to begin putting words and images to this struggle--and maybe find some like-minded folks out there who too find themselves slogging through life  highly functioning  gainfully employed  well liked and quite intelligent but with an insatiable love for pot.  it's a complicted process  to be sure. my relationship with this drug is the longest relationship i've had--just about 15 years now--and it's waxed and waned in it's intensity but it's always been there when i needed it  keeping me as distant and untouchable as i wanted or needed it too.  i've used it the way some use alcohol--as a means to loosen me up in crowds  or make life just that much more interesting.  i've used it to wake me up  to clean my house  to grocery shop  to plant a garden  walk the dog  surf the 'net  drive long distances.  what does a pot smoker look like?  there is no one face.  i am not a deadhead  i am not a fan of jam bands in particular  i have a master's degree in creative writing  i have held a directorship for five years  a committed relationship for seven  i am published  own my own home  my truck  my life. or maybe the latter is not correct. my life is owned by something else  and it's kind and green and comes in so many different and amazing strains.  how did i get here? is it worth the struggle to get out?  if i wasn't such a comparative (as in i am constantly comparing myself to others  holding up the mirror  measuring the lack) junkie  i wouldn't flail so much in the face of quitting  because i know so many others who seem to get along just fine with this particular substance  using it recreationally and not worrying about it.  i get angry.  nobody likes the word addict. it seems so mealy and ugly.  what does an addict look like?  does s/he look like me? would knowing make any difference? i know you're out there.  i know you hear me  you of the family of the green.

  For those of you who know me reasonably well  you might have known that last thursday was my 23rd birthday. Now I'll admit  it wasn't exacltly the star filled night of enjoyment that I hoped for but hey  you can't have everything. But I did  as I do every year  made my new years resolutions that night because for me  the 19th of august is my new year. I decided to have these as my resolutions:  1.Do a couple of pages of notes or one page of new writing everyday.  2.Actually start wearing the nice clothing that people buy for me  and even experiment with a colour that isn't black.  3.Socialise quite a bit more often.  What do you guys think?  What resolutions have you guys ever made?  Josh ,0
  Ahh  the first post.  The beginning of an era of new thought  revelation and inspiration.  What great new thoughts are lurking in the underbrush of our minds  seeking to be found  dancing before us like snow in the wind?  Or we'll just post in on any old stuff that catches our fancy.  Welcome to my blog  I hope you enjoy it.  I am going to try and post at least a couple of times a week  try to stir some creative juices or just start some fights.   Hope you guys get out and put in!!  Josh ,0
"  I just finished reading G.K. Chesterton's ""The man who was Thursday"" on sunday.  I think it is possibly among the more thought stirring books I have ever read  especially the following lines ""When I saw him from the back  I was convinced he was a devil.  But when I saw his face  I knew he was a God.""  It was one of the more powerful lines of the novel  and I won't tell you much more because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet.  I think the most amazing books I have ever read (outside of the Bible) have been mainly fiction ones  that touched my heart rather than the philosophical ones that expanded my mind.  It is quite surprising that these novels are so dear to me considering my own overly cerebral nature.  Ravenheart by David Gemmel  has probably done more for me than Ethics  by Aristotle.  What kind of books are the ones that have made you change your thinking?  Josh ",0
"  After I followed a link to the ""I Love Bees"" blog from  urlLink www.penny-arcade.com  I decided it was about time I actually started my own blog. About six months ago I had started an online journal  but at the time I was drowning myself in Smirnoff frequently (daily) and lacked the motivation to sit down and write. I think now I have the time and mind to actually keep up with this.  When signing up for my blog  I could not for the life of me think of a name for it that would be worthy. I stopped right there. If I don't have a decent name for my blog  what's the point? I figured  something would come to me eventually and it did. I saw Garden State last night (Go see it  it's fantastic!) and it gave me the name for my blog. The movie sums up all the thoughts and feelings going through my mind at this moment in life  thus  my Infinite Abyss will be this blog. I hope you enjoy it. ",0
  During the last week of March 2004  two friends and I were on a road trip to New Orleans for spring break. The three of us fell for a police trap and were arrested in Stone County  Mississippi. My two friends were charged with misdemeanors for possession of marijuana and I was charged with a felony for possession of a controlled substance. I took the wrap for the six hits of acid we had in the car because the two of them had recently discovered they were going to have a baby. If I hadn't taken the blame  all three of us would have been charged with felonies and the two of them would be in much more trouble now than I am.  Flash forward to today...  I am 23 years old. I am a college graduate (Bachelors in Communication  ; Art). I am employed by my father (who spent $4 800 to bail me out of jail). I work as a detailer  graphic designer  and a networking technician. On the weekends I work for an entertainment company as a disc jockey. I have a $3 000 credit card debt  a $17 000 student loan debt  and a $4 800 debt to my parents. One day  within the next year or two  I will have to go to court for the felony. Right now  I barely make enough money to pay my bills and some how I have to save for lawyer fees. Any ideas grounded in reality on how to handle this situation? ,0
"  Hey ... my name's JJ and this is my online diary.  A couple years back  I used to publish this journal on urbanboys.com  which no longer exists.  Basically  I chronicled my ""sexcapades"" and those of my friends.  It was a lot of fun  and it helped me to meet a LOT of great guys ... guys that I will be friends with for life.  But  it was VERY time consuming.  I'm thinking using Blogger will make it much easier  and I've decided to give it another try.  I'll also use this journal to keep you updated on what's going on with my other sites (like  urlLink http://urbanboys.blogspot.com  and  urlLink http://urbanboyoftheweek.blogspot.com ) and how things are going in general with me.  So  not just sex sex sex this time :-)  But  I'm sure there'll be plenty of that  cuz I'm still addicted! (Hahaha) ",0
  urlLink    Um  ok. I had to start by posting some delicious urban boys  right? How about these guys? Yummy :-) ,0
  Hey ... I'm baaaaack ...  Lots of you guys have e-mailed me  asking me to start up the UrbanBoys newsletter again.  I know how much many of you enjoyed it.  Well  how about a compromise?  I'll start this blog  and you can all help me out.  Let me know what you want to see ... it's all yours!  Right now  I'm just getting things set up ... in the next few hours or days  I hope to get the format ready and get started! ,0
  Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh man  I always hate Sunday mornings because of what I do on Saturday nights!  I really should be working on the new  urlLink Urban Boy of the Week  page  because a few of you guys have e-mailed me about it.  I'm not sure that's gonna happen today  though  because I am really HUNG (over) ... haha.  I think today may be a day of rest!

  Our car is broken  my computer is broken  the kitchen is broken  the little oven is broken  I have a bird with a broken wing.  I guess it was broken week and nobody told me.

"  I've been here in the computer for like 3 hours and... I don't want to do my homework!!! *whines*  It's a perfect day  cool  lots of breeze  perfect to sleep  not to do homework!  Are teachers stupid or what?  So yeah  sunday  a good day  I'm here in the computer avoiding homework  listening to NOFX  just made some art for my room and my family was like ""O.o you drew that?"" lol... I hope it's not in a bad sense  like ""oohh  I thought you could draw... and now you draw THAT? THAT?"" lol  So yep  I'm alone  but I'm happy.  I'll stop worrying about the fact that I don't have  a date or anything tonight. After all  in this moment I don't like anybody  and nobody likes me... what can I do.   For those who are good enough to get dates on the weekends  awesome.  But I'll stop feeling bad because of it.   I won't suffer  at least not today.... because  why all lifes have to be that way?  you're little  you play with dolls.  You grow up and Wow! it's time to date! If you don't you're a loser!  I know that's how evolution has made us  our ancient instinct of reproduction living in the lymbic system  that's a primitive system! That's why I have a cortex  I don't have to follow those rules (damn  all this talk made me remember my homework...)... Yeah  I know what you all are thinking... ""Loser""...haha  but I won't suffer... no  I won't. I won't I won't....  *sigh*  I won't.... really. ",0
  I woke up today and everything seemed perfect  but as the day passed  little incidents occured  very little  but a lot of them  mean classmates  embarrasing moment in the cafeteria  lots of homework  boring classes  a chewgum stuck in my braces  .  Note to self:  Never eat chewgum again as long as I have these stupid braces  it took me like an hour to take it off! ,0
  there are so many people in the world. Some of us are trained and broken and some of us are jst broken by choice. Reality sucks and everyone knows it. If you want a meaning in life then you have to find it. But if you want to suceed in life you have to be buried in it.Is there really a choice in what we want? Why do people hate? does anyone Know? I htink that people hate out of fear. Fear of change  fear of difference and fear of everything staying exactly the same. Everyone wants what they cant have  unless they dont have anything at all then they want nothing but need everything. But if you have it all you want everything and need nothing. we inven tmore and more things to make life simple  but in turn it just makes everything more difficult. you have money therefore you dont know what its like to be without or if you dont have any money you dont know what its like to have. everyone is unique  we have our own thoughts  thats what makes us who we are. We all like And dislike different things. we all believe in different things  and everyone says they like it that way but as soon as they find out someone is different from them they want to sprint in opposite directions of eachother or they wnat to make eachother like themselves. Everyones perfect. you all say were not because everyone makes mistakes  and thats what makes us perfect. Our differences and mistakes. NoOne is perfect to us because we base our lives on imperfection  therefore noone knows what perfection is. In order to find out who you are you have to experience as much as you possibly can or else your not giving yourself a chance to be happy. thank you for reading this even though i know its really scattered and probably makes no sense to you. i apologize. ,0
  Did you ever wonder why people care so much? or why anyone shows emotion? emotion is pain and happiness all in the same body emotions overwhelm people so much sometimes it seems unbearable. But then again its not like we can control what we feel. why do people get so angry if someone crys  its neither of there faults because they cant control there emotions. Today my little brother was playing with my feet and it irritates me so much and he just kept on asking me why. i have no idea why thats just how i feel  i dont like it. Can you explain why you feel the way you do about things? ,0
  So  this is the first time I have ever posted something. Been thinking about a lot lately  so this might seem to be pretty random.  Things are changing all around  but I don't really think any of it is really going to make much of a difference. Out with the old  in with the new. New managers to work with at work. New owners to work with at work. Everything is new at work  except for me and what I do. Show up  talk to agents  managers  publicists  local bands  local press  etc. Book shows  promote shows  settle shows. It's almost getting to a point where I feel like I am going through the motions. I don't get as excited as I used to about bands. I'm probably just a lit bit jaded  but I hate booking shows like W.A.S.P.  and ICP and all that other crap. At least by booking these shows  I get the resources to book the bands that I like. Just take the good with the bad.  About to be an uncle for the first time. Pretty excited about that  but I'm kind of scared for my sister. I just hope that she and her boyfriend are able to raise the baby together. I think it would crush her if he ends up leaving. I know that it will all work out in the end  but I have a feeling that it might be kind of a rocky road.  Been thinking about life and love a little bit too much lately. I really miss what it's like to be in a relationship with someone. It's been two years now  and I still find myself thinking about the good times I had with Colleen from time to time. It's not that I miss her  I think I just miss the idea of having someone like her to have around. It's nice to be able to see someone everyday and not get sick of them. Someone with whom I can share my thoughts and feelings.  On a similar note  I think it's time that I start taking care of myself a little bit more. I know that with my personality  I will always want to go out and have a good time. In turn  I think it's time I get off my ass and start trying to be healthier. Thinking about giving up meat again. We shall see. I know that if I manage to lose about 30 lbs  my confidence about my appearance will be a lot higher. Probably would help with the idea of trying to date again. ,0
  but it's Saturday and i have zero to do. being able to be lazy can be such a relief.  the only thing i've done today is change the batterys in my remote and nap. the evening is approaching and i am trying to decide if i should actually get dressed today and socialize. Beth and Mark are having a party tonight  which is always fun. i'm kinda in the mood for something new. maybe i'm just in the mood for someone new..........  i think i'll drink some tea and sit on the couch some more ,0
"  Yesterday I spent my day playing on the Internet and bummed that Erin has not called me back. I really big crush on her. I really miss being with someone and I am definitely looking for love - which is very unlike me.  Greg and I went out last night. I haven't seen him all summer. He was amazingly beautiful as always. It was the first time my friends were introduced to him. My girlfriends went on and on about how hot he was. Eric  my ex  was actually the first to tell me  ""he is a handsome guy "" which I thought was really funny. We got extremely drunk and danced all night long. He came home with me  but I puked before anything could happen.  I like Greg. He is smart and he challenges me intellectually. He is also a great dancer and an awesome kisser. I just dont know if I want a man in my life. I've developed this weird fear of men when it comes to intimacy. Things are a bit different with Greg  probably because he's not acting like he is in love with me. I wonder when he will call again....  Other then that  I am actually considering meeting up with Internet friends at the lesbian bar on Saturday. I'll probably chicken at the out last minute.  I'm going to try my best not to over-think the Greg thing. Or the girl thing. Or anything for that matter. ",0
  I've been missing Nealy a lot lately. I dont want her back. I just crave her friendship  laugh  and maybe the way she holds me. I know I can find that with someone else.  I found this this morning: My heart belongs to my soulmate  and she knows who she is  and for today we are apart  but time will tell  so I wait.. Peace and prayers always. Serenity is not freedom from the storm  but peace within the storm. Sometimes we must let go of the ones we love  so we can love ourself  them  and others more ,0
"  I haven't written any diaries or any other sort of it for a long time.. Not since my last relationship was over a year ago.. But the pain and hurt and unsecurity I feel right now are just too much for me.. It's been overloading and ready to explode.. I need to let it out somehow.. I just can't let it out to the person that actually needs to hear it most..  I don't understand why I'm always in this kind of relationship over and over again.. Why am I always with a man that has no future.. It's always ""no hope-no risk-no commitment"". I don't choose whom I fall in love with.. But it's always men like them..  The man I'm with now is the perfect example of my stupidity.. He's younger than me  we have nothing in common  he's too goodlooking  and not ready for a serious relationship.. I knew that from the very beginning. But somehow  I still let myself to fall in love with him. Why the hell would I do that? Doesn't my brain tell my heart what to do? Is there no connection at all between them?  I've trying to give this man everything.. I thought somehow I would melt his heart and make him fall in love with me.. Oh  I sound so pathetic now.. But now  after 9 months together.. Nothing has changed.. He's still and will never be the man I want him to be.. He make me feel so unsecure.. Especially when it comes to other women. I'm a jealous girl.. He knows that. And it doesn't stop him to get in touch with hix ex's  keep their pictures in his laptop  looking at other girls when he's with me  cooking for other girls and invite them to come over.. If he already has me  why would he do that  right? And what the hell am I doing with him until 9 months? I can't walk away from him.. I wish he copuld change someday.. Somehow.. I don't understand why he's doing this to me.. Does he realize how much he hurt me?  I don't know why I'm typing this.. I should be talking to him no and break up with him.. It would be so much easier if there's no love. I don't want to lose him but it's killing me everyday from all the pain he cause me..  The answer to my problem is so clear. Why can't I just take it? What's wrong with me? ",0
  Acts 20:24--  But my life is worthless unless I use it for doing the work addignes me by the Lord Jesus--the work of telling others the Good News about God's wonderful kindess and love.        Unless I am living my life to do the    work of God       then my life is  worthless.  Not sharing  Christ 's  love  with anyone and everyone is something that should make me feel   guilty  . And I can honestly say that it does. Living 4 Christ    24/7  is my title because I feel like I am supposed to live for Him  24/7 !      Galations 2:20--  I myself no longer live  but Christ lives in me. So I live my life in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God  who loved me and gave himself for me.       Like what I said in the first one  my life is  worthless  unless I use it to share God's love. Well  I cannot do it alone  so Christ lives in me to   help   me and to   guide   me. Allowing  God to live inside of me   gives me a great deal of  comfort.  How else could you feel more comfortable? Having the Son of God inside your  heart  and knowing that He loves you and would do   anything   for you...that's and   amazing   feeling! And I'm so glad that I get to experience it   everyday! ,0
  My opinion on peoples   faith   is   different  . I dont think that anyone can determine how much faith someone has  and I dont think that other people should   judge   someone elses faith. God is apart of   everyone's life   one way or another.   Mostly   everyone knows who God is and the principles behind Him. I think that the way that people   deny   Christ's name so easily is  wrong   but Im not them  so I cant make their decisions for them. But what I can do  is I can work my hardest to be a Godly   example   so that they can see what the Christian life is all about. Being a Christian   isnt   always   fun  . Yes  there are always the occansionally   disappointment   that we run into and from what I have heard  alot of people   blame God   for their   mishaps  . Well  as hard as this might sound  its all apart of God's   master plan  . God allows some misfortunes to happen  to   test   your level of faith that you might have in Him.   BUT    know this  God will   never   test you with more than you can   handle  .  Beliving in  Christianity  or  Evolution . Either one that you believe in  requires   faith!   Faith- believing in something that you cannot see. ,0
  Adventures always start in the most unlikely ways. A random email from someone with the courage to think outside the box ( thanks Si!) has tempted me to dip my toes in the world of the weblog. I don't know where this will lead  if anywhere  but a chance to unjumble some of the thoughts racing round my head can only be a good thing! I think everyone reaches a point where they have to stop and say  is this really the life that God has mapped out for me or am I just imposing his hand on my own faltering steps down the expected path. It's not that I think I'm in the wrong place physically  I just think maybe I'm on the wrong level. I think the catalyst has been the birth of my daughter. Two big blue eyes watch every move I make with unnerving concentration  taking in the things other people may have glossed over in the past. Suddenly I realise that what I say may count for very little as  seeing everything  she's going to see the truth. Don't get me wrong  there are lots of positives  I'm just ready for more. I suppose I'm just looking for a way to let my mind spill on to the screen and see if what lands there starts to make some sense! ,0
  Tonight was a momentous night. Apologies to Kelly Holmes  but while she was achieving her dream of olympic gold my mind was elsewhere. At just about the same time my daughter Ellie took three teetering first steps and our house errupted in a state ot total euphoria. In the seconds following the great event Ellie lost her focus and tumbled towards the ground  only to be swept up in a bear hug and given another chance. We weren't disappointed that Ellie only managed three steps  or even that she fell. Her triumphant grin and clapping hands were enough to melt the coldest of hearts. I can't help but wonder if God ever feels the same way about me. Maybe sometimes I focus too much on the end result and not enough on the joy of having a God who is there when I throw myself on Him in an attempt to do something I could never do without Him. I think next time something doesn't go my way I might try to take a leaf out of Ellie's book. Perhaps I'll clap my hands  grin triumphantly and try again  realising that a little progress can be a pretty big deal. And to Kelly Holmes mother..... I think I know how you feel!!! ,0
"  Hopefully  you have figured out that my ""theme"" is William Shakespeare's  As You Like It . I  of course  am Rosalind  the strong-willed  independant young woman and Orlando is my lover. He left this morning and I was trying to find a way to dispense my emotions. I thought this would be much more exciting than a journal.    As I mentioned he left this morning. It is the strangest feeling for him to be so distant. Orlando holds in his chest the other half of my soul. I feel empty without him. They say ""absence makes the heart grow fonder."" I hope this is just a little bump in the cobble-stone street. We have been together for 3 years. Most couples are married by that time  but our ages keep us waiting. We are still young and must establish our careers first. I have small doubt that our love will fail  I just hope my Orlando will not be tempted by an Eve to eat (or whatever else) a forbidden fruit.   If the fruit is ""consumed"" I will be left with no other choice but to close the gates of Eden  not matter the pain. But once again  I have small doubt. Our love is strong and shall brave the elements! I love Orlando...as he does me.   But ""True is it that we have seen better days."" -William Shakespeare   As You Like It ",0
"  My day was horrible today.  Apart from the ""drama"" in ""Shakespeare's theatre"" my heart was tied in a knot.  After coming home my madre informed me that Orlando would not be coming home this weekend because he had something to do in Bristol.  I do understand that this is a new life both exciting and adventurous  but I also understand the pain I experienced when realizing I would not see him for another week.  I knew this wouldn't be easy  it just sucks.  There are beautiful  sophisticated girls there and I am some simpleton with which there lies no mystery or intrigue.  I am old  boring and worn out.   Also  I know that I am a bit too dramatic and am making this situation sound much worse than it is  but heck  this is a journal for me right?  I can say whatever the hell I want to!  I really want Orlando to follow his heart and if he wants to participate in anything he can go for it.  I want him to enjoy college  experience new things and have fun...I just miss him...that's all.  I love Orlando. ",0
  Hi there.  I don't plan on telling anyone I know about this blog spot. Fuck it. I have been on an eating binge since Friday.   On Friday I ate mushrooms and had an awesome time hanging out with some people I am just getting to know. It does seem however that I am not going to be hooking up with one of the girls like I had hoped.  Which makes about 31 times in a row for me to fall into that gray area called the friend with no benefits zone.   I am going to be a dick from now on.  Not that I feel like a dick but I don't want to be disappointed  by some shitty friendship where I get to hear some girl cry about her exotic exboy friend.  Fuck him.  That pillow biter. Fuck her.  I cover the tabs and she knows why.  Once a month she might pretend she wants me over after he neglects to call her because he is getting it some where else. And God forbid I summon the courage to bust a move.  Even on an eight of strong mushrooms I can't put aside my cowardice and at least offend someone with my rotten cigarette breath kisses.  I had gum.  My trip lasted way longer than everyone else and she clearly did not want me to even sleep on her couch but I couldn't just up and drive home  i was seeing 8 of everything and they were all melting.  I did feel bad wandering around the tiny apartment zapped out of my mind while she slept.  I did bug out at the beginning of the night.  There were about 45 minutes to an hour where I could not bring myself to say one word.  I think everyone else was starting to think that either I was retarded  angry with them  or even more retarded.  Lucky I did break out with some good material and get some good laughs.  So did my friend's cousin   she also had some funny moments.  I keep sending weird text messages this girl.  I even called her and left a message with the excuse that I couldn't find my wallet just so she would call me back and tell me it wasn't at her apartment.  but to most people this probably isn't a new trick.  what is wrong with me.  why don't girls like me? Fuck friendships.  I will never again establish another plutonic friendship with a lady.  I don't care who beats her. ,0

  Well its back to work today  ugh! I had such a nice weekend  I really dont feel like putting in 12 hours today. We put the new awning up  painted the shed floor and installed a new security light  and still had time to watch a movie : Talking Lives.........a very scarey movie with alot of twists  needless to say I liked it. ,0
"  I am so happy to have today off work.  By the time work  was over yesterday  I  felt emotionally spent. The women I work with  are such ""bitches"" well at least most of them. I was told how  yesterday morning I  was the main topic of  conversation on the  first floor  I  guess it  pisses  some people off because  I am paid  from the  moment I clock in  I guess they  don't  realize  that I  go right to work  I  dont  stand  around  for  10-15 minutes and gossip. I am pretty  quiet for the most part at work because I don't want to be a part of  the  junior high games  that  go on there  but  I  will say I   truely love my job and I refuse to let the  38-50 year old  crowd  ruin it  for me. I  do  have  one  very close  friend I work  with ""Julie""  we  have a deep connection  much deeper than anyone  there is  aware of   we  can  talk about anything and even if we  don't  agree on something  thats  okay. I have shared many of my  life's secrets with her and she  doesnt judge me  it is so nice to have  a special friend like that!  Enough about my work life. Today I  took a vacation day because  I am  taking my children to register for  school. They will get their  schedules  order yearbooks  and get school pictures done. My  daughter is  especially  excited  because  she has  lost  55lbs and looks  terrific  that  along  with   getting contact lens's really has  boosted  her self esteem. Tonight I have to take her to  9th grade orientation and she  cant  wait to  see the  expressions of  peoples faces. My  son is kind of  excited about  going back to school  he anticipates  wrestling  season  and this will also  be the  first year since  middle  school he  will not participate in band.  Last night the hubs and  I  watched ""Godsend"" let me  tell you save  your  money! ",0

  Hi  today is my first day with blogger. My life is going pretty good as of right now. I meet this really nice girl. She's every thing I've ever wonted. I'm just haning on and seeing were God is going to take me. This summer I had a chance of a life time by going on a mission trip to Panama in Latin america. I have devoped a much better realtionship with christ. I feel that it was and is a life changing event that has helped me out in so many ways that know one will ever know. I need to go but  God Bless ,0
  So my other writtings talk about this alwsome girl. We'll I really like her and I won't to take our realtionship to the next level. Right now we are like just talking. But I would like to ask her out. But right now she is confused. I really don't understand why thou. I know about this guy that like's her  but she's told me that there just friend's and she wouldn't date him. So I don't think thats that she is confused about  unless she does like him  but I trust her. I just don't understand. I keep praying that God will just be there and help me and guid me in all I do. I just don't won't to pressure her and lose her like I have in last realtionships. She is just so awsome  and I don't won't to lose her. She is like every thing I have ever wonted. ,0

  Hey everyone! I'll be using my blog to post rants I make during computer class at STA! ,0
"  Rant Number 2 Second day of school Oy  now we start actual keyboardingwhat great joy! **coughcough** I really suck at normal keyboardingIt definitely isnt one of my strong points. I type my own way really. Its sorta mixed up proper typing with index finger typing. You know  where you only use your index fingers to press down every single letter? Haha thats how I used to type when I didnt know how to. Well this is really boring These keyboarding books look cool tho they are more like notepads for learning how to keyboard correctly. AHHHH this is messing up my normal typing  learning this gay new way of typingbleah this sucks. I remember learning this in sixth grade with Mr. Donovan he was nice  but the class sucked. **15 minutes later** OMG Im going to kill myself because this is so much different from my normal style of typing that its driving me crazy! I suck at the normal style of typing! All we are doing is a sad dad; all lads fall; asl a lass; a jak salad; BLARGH! WHO FREAKING CARES ABOUT A SAD DAD OR A JAK SALAD! WTF IS A JAK SALAD?! I dont know but its retarded just like these books I really need to either go outside or get some help. Mental help. :P I cant wait till lunch  cause I have a yummy sandwich (yummy!) and THE SCHOOLS COOKIES! Omg those cookies are teh best! THEY R0X325 my 50( 1337 ARE TEH BEST! These cookies are sooooo good. Chocolatey chippy cookies! Yummzors! I think Im going crazy. Nevermind I AM crazy. I like monkeys. That was random. Haha memories from literature yesterday ""This is Michael Miller my partner  he lives in Randolph in the middle of nowhere  he has 40 pets not including his 49 toads as his pond (yes he counted)  he likes to feed house spiders  he used to catch snakes  and he likes to put things into sockets and make them explode!"" XD that was hilarious! ""This is Nate  he weighs 268 pound  is 610  and is a beast  an-"" ""Thank you. Nate  congrats on making a bad impression of yourself on the first day. Your permanent assigned seat will be over there."" Hahahaha that was so funny! Well its about time for me to head cause computer class is over See you all in the asylum!  (haha j/k) ",0
  Why did I have to be your mistake? Put together with pieces of me and you... You had to change me into something you could never be  I'm not me anymore  I'm just like you  the sad thing is that you knew...  I was never a person in the first place  Just like the rest  there was nothing inside me but dust... You saw potential for an evil heir to your throne  I knew there was something more than hate  but now I'm not so sure just what to trust...  They all point fingers at me and blame  They're just like you  thinking they're perfect... I can see through them  like you saw through me  Just like me  they're all a defect...  Why did I have to be your mistake? Why did you have to make me aware? I wish sometimes that I couldn't see  Cause when I look in the mirror  you're there... ,0
"  i get to go to practice tonite. im gonna call eryn later and sing to her  but i dont know what yet. im thinking maybe i dont wanna miss a thing  but ill prolly come up with something better by then. My head hurts so bad  and its my fault because i kissed her when she had a cold. Thats what happens  people tell me not to do stuff  but do i listen? No. Why?

  Hello all. This is my blog. Instead of use it as just a play-by-play of my how my day went  I'll probably use it as a place to dump my opinions. This is my little corner of the internet  so to speak. And I'll use it to show the world my superiority. Because no matter what you say  I'm better than all of you.  *cough* Anyway....  So  yeah  I hope you all enjoy reading this. If you don't  oh well  it's obviously all your fault.  Well  I'll cya next post. ,0

  Today started like anyother monday. I woke up crabby becuse I didnt get to sleep until about12:00. I know that doesnt seem late but I need about 9 hours of sleep in order to be in a good mood. When I got to school my I heard an announcement that we had to meet in the gym at fourth period to listen to our new vice principal ramble on and on about all the new rules. Then when I got to seventh period my class got in an argument with our teacher about how to organize our binders. After I got home I did my homework and then BBQed some hamburgers for dinner. Now I'm starting a blog for the first time. ,0
  Today was a regular school day. I got to school and survived through Mr.Perez going on about Jewish law. Then I went to Web Design and watched a pretty interesting video on the history of the internet. After a short break I showed up for Biology and did really good on our quiz. Thats when things started going down hill. When I got into fourth period I had a really bad headache. Then at lunch by the time i got my food it was time to go to class. Spanish and Algebra were easy. Then came AVID. I had to listen to my new AVID teacher talk about how things are going to be different this year. We've been going over this for the past four days. It's getting pretty old. Well after that I came home did my homework and started on this. Thats about everything that happened to me today. ,0
  Today was actually a pretty good day for me. I did well on my Biology quiz and was great during Spanish. I guess i got enough sleep last night. I was pretty tired. When I woke up this morning i wasnt very crabby about waking up at 6:30. Today my Web Design teacher (Mr.Briggs) assigned us a project. We have to keep a blog for three days and then email the address to him so he can see how it's going. My Bio teacher has to be the most boring man alive. He wont look at anyone when he is talking and his voice is monotone. He told us today that one of his hobbies is to go to southern California to catch spiders to keep in the class room. He also told us that his job before he was a teacher was to go through a jar of goop takeing out all the fish larva and fish eggs. he seemed pretty proud of it. I think it was pretty pathetic. Oh well thats all that happened to me today. ,0
"  This is my first post so bear with me.  I want to start by saying that I love life  I just think that sometimes people are delt a messed up hand.  Why can't some of us have some happiness sometime. I have a wonderful son that I thank GOD for everyday.  He is truely the light of my life.  When I found out that I was pregnant  I worried ""what am I going to do with a kid?""  now I wonder what I ever done without him.  If somthing ever happened to my son I would die. With that said I want to know why am I so sad?   I failed at being a wife. (I only got married because I was pregnant and thought it was the right thing to do. there was no love involved). I wonder if I ever will fall in love.  Who knows maybe one day.   I just hate the weeks that my son is at his dads becouse those weeks are very hard to get through  not that anyone cares anyway. ",0
  Today was an intresting day to say the least. Sometimes I wonder way the hell things are the way they are. I try to be a nice person but when you are nice  people will run the hell all over you. Today I had to turn in my best friend for getting a traffic ticket and giving the officer my name instead of hers. Did I just call her my best friend?........ With friends like that i'm set for life huh?. Well I bet she wont do it again. I guess I can cross her name off my Christmas list.    On another note my son had a good day in school today. I couldn't be more proud. I was so worried when he started school but I think that he will do fine.    As for my love life  thats not doing fine at all. I am intrested in someone but I just don't think he sees it  or me for that matter. I've done everything possible to get him to notice me.   Don't get me wrong we talk quite often but there is always people around. Hell maybe he just isn't intrested. I could see that as the problem. I'll keep hoping. I have nothing better to do......... ,0
  Hey  life. I am kinda sceptical about this whole talking to myself on the internet thing  it just doesn't seem like something I would do...But hell  I have one life  so I might as well try everything once. Just so anyone who views this knows  I am a 17 year old junior in High School  I play football  basketball  track  and golf (I am a starter on all teams)  and I love hanging out and hooking up (what's new  right?). Any-hoo  today was a pretty weird day. It started like a usual day  getting a ride with my mom to school cuz my licsense is legally suspended. Going to first period was nothing new  but it was what happened afterwards that really kinda upset me. For about the past two weeks  I have been helping out a friend (who is a girl  just for clarification)  get a guy that she really liked. Well she finally got him  and I like to think it was me that got her the guy. She was scared  and I gave her confidence in making the first move. She didn't want to hurt friends  so I went and told the friends just how the girl felt so that they wouldn't get in a fight over him. She asked me every night what to talk about and every night she told me just how much she liked him. Getting back to the point  she walked up and told me she finally asked him out and he said yes. The part that really hit me was that it was then that I realized  How can I get her a boyfriend  yet I can't even tell the girl that I like that I like her???I pretty much got those two people going out  and yet I can't get a girlfriend  I can't tell the girl I like that I like her  and I can't even manage my own life  but yet I helped my friend get her life in better shape. How is that????If you have an answer or an opinion  post back please. ,0
  Ok  so just to sum up a couple of things  if you are reading this BEWARE! I am going to experiment. I am going to attempt (key word  a-t-t-e-m-p-t) to just sometimes take a step back and look at what all I am doing in life and what-not. Read it or not  please post a comment afterwards so I don't go insane thinking I am talking to myself. I ask for your opinions  your comments  or just a good ole Hey  just because you have nothing better to do. Anyways  on with the blogging. (I guess it is blogging  sounds kinda funny to me.) ,0
  How exciting. Okay  gotta go now. I want to mess around with the settings and figure out how to post pictures and links. Ciao. ,0
  Hoss is my bulldog (for anyone that sees this but doesn't know me)  and he is a spoiled one at that. This how we have found him when we came home on several occasions. You can't see it in the picture  but there was a Corona on the railing and his daddy was grilling hamburgers for us...including him.  I wonder what he does that we don't see...maybe I don't want to know  eh?  Anyway  he does weigh at least 62 lbs here. He still thinks he's small enough to be a lap dog  and will climb up in my lap every time he gets tired just to prove it. Of course  at that point I am pinned and have to move a mountain to get up out of the chair. But he has more kisses than I can stand sometimes  and plenty left over for anyone that comes to visit.  I'm definitely a Bulldogger! ,0
  Well  I took Hoss to get neutered this morning. Poor thing  he was so excited it makes me think he has no idea what is to come. He was like a wild thing this morning  playing and running around this morning. The ride in the car was great! We were stuck trying to find a place to get across to the vet's office through all the traffic  and he just watched all the cars and trucks go by. He really loves to watch the cars and truck moving.  Then we got there  and I had to take him over to the side to go potty before we went into the office. He was a total spaz there! I could hardly contain him and in fact  he got loose of his collar and scared a poor little shih-tzu. They called someone from the back to come get him once I put the collar back on and I appologized to the little dog that was just shaking.  Anyway  he goes under the knife between 11 and 2 today  and I can call to check on him later. Then tomorrow he gets a bath before his daddy goes to pick him up. He'll be like a whole new dog!  Here's a little pic of him when he was a baby...that seems so long ago.  He's only about 7lbs there  but he weighed 62lbs last time he went to the vet.  He's 9 months old now and so handsome! ,0
"  It's amazing what some people will do for fun and excitement. Although  in telling about this I incriminate myself. But anyway.  So we all (a group of people...I guess as opposed to dogs  cats  aliens  or rubber duckies) decided we wanted to take a walk along the canal. However  the weather decided it was going to rain at the same time. Now  rain would usually stop a sane person from taking a walk outside  but no...no one ever said we were sane. So we walked...in the rain and lightning and thunder...with umbrellas held high...all in the name of fun (and  oh yeah...exercise).  My official battle cry was  ""It's just water.""  Hmm...it's a shame we don't go out and play in the rain more. ",0
"  One Sunday morning  a mother went in to wake her son and tell him it was time to get ready for church  to which he replied  ""I'm not going.""  ""Why not?"" she asked.  ""I'll give you two reasons "" he said. ""One  they don't like me  and two  I don't like them.""  His mother replied  ""I'll give  you  two good reasons why you  should  go to church. One  you're 54 years old  and two  you're the pastor!"" ",0
"  A kindergarten teacher gave her class a ""show and tell"" assignment. Each student was instructed to bring in an object to share with the class that represented their religion.  The first student got up in front of the class and said  ""My name is Benjamin and I am Jewish. This is a Star of David.""  The second student got up in front of the class and said  ""My name is Mary. I'm Catholic  and this is a Rosary.""  The third student got up in front of the class and said  ""My name is Tommy. I am a Baptist  and this is a casserole."" ",0
"  Okay  so I decided to start a Blog. I remember a few years back when some friends of mine were doing the ""blog thing"" and I didn't really care for it. But recently a friend of mine told me I should be keeping a journal of all the craziness that goes on in my life...so here it is. ",0
"  This will be my first time to write something on the net that would be available for ""public scrutiny""...but what the hell...im not even sure if someone is really interested with some dorks' unending rants and bitching...  so lets start off....  i will be calling this entry as ""Here's where the stories dont end""....i dont know why im even calling it as is...but i think we will surely find out by the end of this enrty...or not....  a couple of months ago i was logged on to friendster...(yes im doing friendster....sue me!!!) and there was this picture of some chick with the perfect stereotype look of an ""emo"" girl...so i got curious...and as i read her profile..i cant help but think if this girl has been reading ""how to look 'emo'"" on SEVENTEEN...coz shes got it all going...the black nail polish  the black shirt...what have you....and im not exagerating here when i say that evey line in her bio doesnt fail to have  the word ""emo""...i will surely admit i was appalled by this girls' image she seemed to be forcasting through out the internet....so i directly sent her a message containing how i was mortified by her audacity...i was on a mission to brutalize her and strip her down to her bone...i told her she was a poser....well...i didnt say it directly...but i was leaning into it...who the fuck listens to coheed and cambria anyway and calls themselves emo??? lo and behold  after a couple of days i got a reply...she was arrogant...i was arrogant...but i wont let this slut get away that easy... she wrote things like she is emo..that she listens to emo  sleeps emo...breathes emo...and all that one dimensional perception bullcrap....so i mabe a comeback...i wrote things like everybody feels...and what the hell is emo anyway??? i even wrote that emo is a brand that corporate sluts made just to categorize music and sell them to mindless twits....then again i didnt say it straight faced...i was just leaning into it :)....a couple of days later i got a reply...this time she changed her user name from something like emo gurl to ""what is emo""...hahaha...fuck you bitch!!!! this time she was asking me if i think she is a poser....hahahaha...i sure did!!!! but i am a kind man....hahaha....i told her that she is the sole judge to her own self...and no one elses'...but everybody knows thats bullshit!!!! BITCH! ",0
  Hello and blessed be to all! Well  this is the beginning of my new journal. I had one on AOL  but for personal reasons moved my writings of my escapades to BloggerLand. I've also had numerous physical journals and I've only recently started online journals. As you can see  I love to write. It is one of my greatest passions and sometimes I must write to feel better.  I'm also just as passionate about history  theater  and Paganism. So I guess you could call me a Pagan writer-actor-historian.   Lil' bit bout myself: My name's Brian and I'm 17  living in Hartford  CT. I go to Bulkeley High School and the Academy of the Arts  and I'm overall happy with that. I'm a senior now  and life doesn't seem any different. I guess it's because of my up bringing that I feel like that. You see  I live with my mother  stepfather  and three brothers and our family's pretty boring. For all you kids out there with no siblings  I HATE you. You are too lucky. Siblings-especially brothers-can be a pain in the arse. Trust me  I have three of them!!   A couple of things have made my existence a bit more bearable. Firstly  my faith. I am a proud and out-of-the-broom-closet Pagan who loves the Great Mother. I've been Pagan for five years  and my specialty is healing and the Tarot. I have more Pagan books than I don't know who  and for the most part they were worth the money. I'm also blessed with the gift of the arts. I have dabbled in just about all the arts: painting  photography  songwriting  puppetry  but my two favorites are theater and writing. Though I don't want to be a professional actor  I still at least want to be an  amateur  actor; amateurism deserves more dedication than a hobby  but not as much as a profession.  I just love the theater  but being a professional actor is too harsh a life for me. I want to be a history professor. It isn't as exciting as being an actor  but I love it nonetheless. It is also a very flexible career  and it'll allow me to write--my other passion.     I hope to one day be a published author  but right now I'm just writing. I usually never finish a story or elaborate an idea  but at least I'm writing it down. Eh? I write all kinds of shtuff  but short stories are my speciality. As I continue to write in my journal  I'll slip in a piece or two to entertain any and all.    Well  that's enough writing for now. Enjoy my escapades!! ,0
  Not really to state that I am an expert on what goes on in the world that we live in  but I wanted to share what I noticed and felt to be prominent. I am a musician. I write songs  and I am too afraid to perform  but I am not afraid to express my feelings or opinions. I wanted to share my first song with you. Please let me know what you think  or how it affected you. I want to know how other people interpret my lyrics.   Pleading      Death was the phase that made me realize   What a privilege it was to look into your eyes.   I could not take it  and now I'm in a daze.   Won't you give me tomorrow  like I had yesterday?      I walk around in the darkness of night.   It's very cold  but I can't go inside.   I stand there freezin' and still see your face.   I can't stop screamin'; I distance this place.      Won't you give me tomorrow  like i had yesterday?    Can I tell youI'm sorry and make the pain go away?   'Cause I can't go on walkin' and cryin' this way.   I'm tellin you I need you even though it's too late.      Lookin' back when I picked up my phone;   I heard those words and could not be at home.   i started divin'  didn't say that you could go.   My heart stopped beatin'; I couldn't rescue my soul.      What makes you think that I could take us both    and keep on treadin' through a thousand feet of snow?   You quit goin' yet I had to go on.   How could you do this? Can you see that yo were wrong?      Won't you give me tomorrow  like I had yesterday?    Would you talk to me about it? Could I block out all your pain?   Could I help you go on living  or could I take your place?   How could you do this to me? I want Yestrday.    So  let me know what you think. You can e-mail me at   urlLink  duck_lover69@hotmail.com     or   urlLink  erica.baker@ichotelsgroup.com   .  This was the first song that I wrote. It came to me as I sat outside a movie theatre waiting for the show.  I would like to say that today was rather unproductive. I wanted to write music  but instead I have created this blog. Maybe more will come of the latter  than the music.  I guess that I will blog more later.   Until then I sleep  per chance to dream.  E. ,0
  Well tonight things finally came to a collapse. Erika has finally decided she can't try and hold on to what we have had going for over 3 years. After a long talk on the phone  and her broken down in tears  many kind words exchanged back and forth  a little bit of laughter now and then  but mostly silence  trying to decide what to say. She has decided to stick with Troy because he is there for her  since i live 8 hours away. My heart was broken  after 3 years of keeping it going. I will cherish the last time i saw her  only 3 weeks ago  driving 8 hours leaving at 1 in the morning on a spur of the moment to go see her because my parents were out of town. Spending a whole day  and night with her was the most amazing thing i have ever experienced. After cuddeling all night  and falling asleep  we woke up early in the morning  and both started getting closer. Eventually  we ended up making sweet love for the first time which is the most amazing thing i have ever experienced with her. Only a few hours later i had to go home. Then  tonight  i found out that the big pit i was feeling in my stomach the other night was true. This past weekend she went and did it with Troy....I cant explain how i felt. I know they were dating but i was shocked. We talked some more  trying to work things out  but you know it doesnt work out that great. Both said a few things we shouldnt. She wanted to try and get rid of our emotions for each other  she said all her stuff  then i asked her if she really wanted me to say how i felt  and she said yes. After a long time of me talking  she was shocked of how much i really felt for her because this was truely the first time i was able to tell her i dreamed  and wanted to marry her someday. But  i was too late. She is with troy for the past couple months  if only i could have told her sooner my true feelings  but i didnt; now i am too late to care for her  she said its over forever. Hopefully i will still be able to talk to her. Night ended with a long silence  i could hear her crying in the background  a long silence  and the line goes dead. I am dieing  and really need to talk to her  call once  twice  5 times  7 times  4 voicemails later  i give up  give one last call to tell her sweet dreams and have a good day at school. Then i head to the gym to try and work off some of what this night has brought. I have decided to write down the Soap Opra we have had for the past 3 years...... ,0
  as you can see from the last post i dont really have the smooth talk like u see in the action movies but i was wondering if anyone has any tips or suggestions or ideas on what to say to: a girl i dont know: a girl i kind of know: a girl i really know: my best female friend: ,0
"  im kind of new to this blogging thing so what im gonna probabally do is explain what i do on a day o day basis. before i go on i do gotta tell you that i am in high school and may not spell things correctley or use proper english and sometimes thethings i may tell you about may sound kind of childish but the people i hang out with are open like this.  to start ou i wanna tell u  about this girl i like  im not gonna tell u her name but lets call her ms.n  about all year i have been seeing her in the hall but couldnt like ask her out or anything cuz i was with someone  so when i finally broke up with her i was like  hey now i can talk to her  so u know i started by saying wazzup or how are u doing. im kind of a shy guy and dont really talk to that many girls  not that im gay or n e thing  but im shy  so i told a couple of my friends and they like the loosers they are went and told her before i could  not that i was in a rush to tell her and all but they were like she was like she was flattered and all but that was it.  so my friend was like go up to her and talk to her so i was like ok i got it all planned out im a go up to her and be like ""wazzup u know i like u and all cuz i know all these people been tellin you and i wanted to know if i could get your numer and mabey i could call u some times"" so i had practiced it in front of the mirror and had it down pat and ready to do it.  so i went up to her and did it and do u beleive that she said no   well not so brief and short and blunt  but she was like  i dont really give my number out to that many people  so i was like thats cool so i left it at that.

  did u see american idol  man i didn't know who would win 'wink' 'wink' but congrats to fantashia or how ever u spell her name but i knew since Jennifer Hudson was voted off that she was going to win.  sorry no love stories today i had standardized testing all day and didn't see her all day probabally the same will go for tomorrow so maybe friday u may get some more. ,0
